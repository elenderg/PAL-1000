To create a vertex array given some vertices:
Create the vertex array given the vertices' count.
Put the vertex array's spot pointer into a spot pointer.
Loop.
Get a vertex from the vertices.
If the vertex is nil, exit.
Put the vertex's spot into the spot pointer's target.
Add the vertex's spot's magnitude to the spot pointer.
Repeat.
