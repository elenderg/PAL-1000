To create a path in the file system (directory):
Privatize the path.
Remove any trailing backslash from the path.
Null terminate the path.
Call "kernel32.dll" "CreateDirectoryA" with the path's first and 0 returning a number.
Clear the i/o error.
If the number is not 0, exit.
Put "Error creating directory '" then the path then "'." into the i/o error.
