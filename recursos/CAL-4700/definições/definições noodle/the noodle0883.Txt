To draw a roundy box with a border color and a fill color (pdf style):
If the border and the fill are clear, exit.
If the roundy box's radius is 0, draw the roundy box as a box with the border and the fill (pdf style); exit.
Put the roundy box's radius into a radius.
Put the radius times 2 into an offset.
Put the roundy box into a box.
Output setcolor given the border and the fill.
\ initial moveto
Output moveto given the box's left and the box's top plus the radius.
\ left-top
Put the box's left and the box's top and the box's left plus the offset and the box's top plus the offset into an ellipse.
Output the arc of the ellipse given "left-top".
Output lineto given the box's right minus the radius and the box's top.
\ right-top
Put the box's right minus the offset and the box's top and the box's right and the box's top plus the offset into the ellipse.
Output the arc of the ellipse given "right-top".
Output lineto given the box's right and the box's bottom minus the radius.
\ right-bottom
Put the box's right minus the offset and the box's bottom minus the offset and the box's right and the box's bottom into the ellipse.
Output the arc of the ellipse given "right-bottom".
Output lineto given the box's left plus the radius and the box's bottom.
\ left-bottom
Put the box's left and the box's bottom minus the offset and the box's left plus the offset and the box's bottom into the ellipse.
Output the arc of the ellipse given "left-bottom".
\ finish up
