To limit a spot to a box:
If the spot's x is less than the box's left, put the box's left into the spot's x.
If the spot's y is less than the box's top, put the box's top into the spot's y.
If the spot's x is greater than the box's right, put the box's right into the spot's x.
If the spot's y is greater than the box's bottom, put the box's bottom into the spot's y.
