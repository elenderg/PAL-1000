To get a drive name for a path:
Privatize the path.
Null terminate the path.
Put 512 into a length.
Reassign a buffer's first given the length.
Call "kernel32.dll" "GetVolumeInformationA" with the path's first and the buffer's first and the length and 0 and 0 and 0 and 0 and 0 returning a number.
If the number is 0, clear the drive name; exit.
Convert the buffer's first as a pchar to the drive name.
