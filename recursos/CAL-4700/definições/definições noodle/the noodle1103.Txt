To get a column# given a row and a spot and a text:
Put 0 into the column#.
If the text is nil, exit.
If the row is nil, exit.
Get a box given the row and the text.
If the spot's y is greater than the box's bottom, put the row's string's length into the column#; exit. \ only happens on last row of text
Create the hfont of the memory canvas given the text's font.
Get a start width and a substring given the row and the spot and the text (for "get a column# given a row...").
Loop.
If the substring's last is the row's string's last, break.
Get a width given the substring and the memory canvas.
Add the start width to the width.
Get another width given the substring's last's target and the memory canvas.
Divide the other width by 2.
Subtract the other width from the width.
If the spot's x is less than the width, break.
Add 1 to the substring's last.
Repeat.
Put the substring's last minus the row's string's first plus 1 into the column#.
Destroy the hfont of the memory canvas.
