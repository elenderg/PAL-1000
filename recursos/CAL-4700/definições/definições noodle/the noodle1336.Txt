To insert a string into another string before a byte#:
If the string's length is 0, exit.
Privatize the byte#.
Limit the byte# to 1 and the other string's length plus 1.
Slap a substring on the other string. \ left side
Put the substring's first plus the byte# minus 2 into the substring's last.
Slap another substring on the other string. \ right side

Copy bytes from the string's first to the third substring's first for the string's length.
Add the string's length to the third substring's first.
Copy bytes from the other substring's first to the third substring's first for the other substring's length.
