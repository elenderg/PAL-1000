Yo, Darin!

In here, you're in blue and I'm in black.

\Just wanted to thank you for allowing me access into your mail server. 

You're welcome.
But please don't share the trick with anyone else - there are a lot of nasty people on the internet
and we don't want them messing up our files.

\I have copied over all of the sample programs, and will be studying them as soon as these depositions are finished.

That's great. You should delete them (and the other items) from your mailbox soon,
or it's going to fill up with stuff and it will be hard to find new messages since the default sort is by file name.

I put a copy of the CAL-4707 in our shared directory. It differs from the 4700 in just one way:
it lets you sort files by creation date, which helps when a mailbox gets too full of stuff.
After you sort by date, the latest "mail" will be at the bottom of the list.
You can use the "Reverse" command to move it to the top.

\I did run a couple of them and they work great!

Glad to hear it. I hope I didn't leave too much extraneous commented code in them.

\Thanks again and God Bless!

Ditto.

Gerry
