\ Jasper,

I wrote a "splash a color" turtle demo to figure out
some issues with measuring the differences between colors,
and with picking "a color near a color".

\ Cool. Here's what happened when I tried to run it:

\ Using the CAL-4700, I made a new directory with a file for the program you sent
\ plus your 4018 NOODLE and TURTLE libraries.
\ Then I tried to run it.
\ The compiler couldn't find the "bigint" type, so I added your BIGINT library.
\ (I think "big integer" is the way we say that in English.)
\ Then the "byte pointer" type was undefined, so I added your CHARACTERS library.
\ Then the "colorref" type was missing, so I added your COLORS library.
\ Then the "lightness ratio" type was missing, so I added your RATIOS library.
\ Then the "flag array" type was missing, so I added your ARRAYS library.
\ Then the "mixio" type was missing, so I added your TRIG  library.
\ Then the "row#" type was missing, so I added your TEXT  library.
\ Then the "console" type was missing, so I added your CONSOLE library.

\ So it turns out I needed 10 libraries to make this work, only 2 or 3 of which seem reasonable
\ to include on the face of it. For example, why should a graphics-only program need the
\ CHARACTERS, TEXT, and CONSOLE libraries?

\ I know I've said it before, but I think you've got this thing chopped up too much.
\ And not organized for the programmer's ease of use.

\ I think I could reasonably argue that EVERY program needs COLORS (if only black and white)
\ and that any type that the Compiler knows about (ie, understands literals of that type, or assumes
\ that type is defined for some other reason) ought to be part of the basic Noodle
\ (like BYTE POINTERS, RATIOS and, in your case, BIGINTS and maybe MIXIOs).
\ If that were the case, the program would have compiled and run for me on my first or second --
\ instead of my ninth -- try.

\ Anyway, it ran. But it looked kind of ugly because it only occupied 1/2 of my screen
\ minus about 1/2 inch at the bottom -- even though the program says "clear the screen"
\ without further qualification.

\ Unsolicited tip: I replaced "wait for 3 seconds" with "wait for the escape key" so I could
\ study the output more closely. I do this a lot in "quicky" programs.
