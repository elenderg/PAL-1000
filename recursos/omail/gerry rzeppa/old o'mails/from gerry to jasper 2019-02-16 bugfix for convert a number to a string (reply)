\ Jasper:

I hope you have been well.

\ Yes, thank you. I hope you have been well also.

I have started working on adding a 64-bit "bigint" signed integer
to the CAL-40xx series.  As part of my testing, I noticed that
a bug in how the smallest number is converted to a string.
The de-signing step (wisely, in my opinion) treats
the absolute value of the smallest number as being equal
to the largest number.  Unfortunately, this makes the
string conversion of the smallest number incorrect.

\ Good catch!

This bug can be fixed by adding the following line of code
to the end of the following routine in CAL-4700's noodle:
To put a number into a string;
To convert a number to a string:
[...]
If the original number is the smallest number, add 1 to the string's last's target.

This works because the smallest number is always even,
so there is no possibility of incrementing a 9,
so there is no need to worry about rollover.

\ Or we could handle the exception at the top of the routine with a sentence like this:

If the original number is the smallest number, put "-2147483648" into the string; exit.

\ Now that I think about it, we could handle all the conversions that way.
\ Just kidding.

\ I'll put this on the fix list.

\Thanks,

\ Gerry
