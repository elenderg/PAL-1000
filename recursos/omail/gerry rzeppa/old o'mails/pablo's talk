Dear Gerry,
I can't launch sudoku solver in the net drive.
I will try in my hard drives after copy it.

Now it's working on my hard drive.
But I can't solve it, there is no cursor to write numbers, and it only presents solved puzzle after Enter pressed.

I'm reading the code, there is no way to be solved by me :-)

About the oMail: it could be O'Mail, like and Irish surname ;-)

It is wonderful to have net connectivity through this.
