Hello, Walter!

Welcome to O'mail (Osmosian Mail).

You can communicate with other Osmosians here. Just use the CAL to make a text file on
your computer (don't work directly in this directory), then copy your file and paste it into the
recipient's "mailbox." You can also send and receive CAL-created documents and Plain English
program directories in this way.

Note the naming convention for message file names:

\ from gerry to walter 2019-06-24 welcome to o'mail

Note also that you can "color up" a line by making it a "comment", as above.

I check my O'mail box nearly every day; I can't say the same for others, unfortunately.

Gerry
