You still could use this approach for the turtle graphics.

\ I agree, and one day, when I get around to it, I will make the split and
\ write the documentation. But it will be a while before that happens.

Do you have any other concerns about CAL-4017
that I should address before releasing CAL-4018?
CAL-4018 will include the ability to sort o'mail by date.

\ I modified the CAL (temporarily) to sort files by date and tried it
\ with the O'mail, but frankly, it didn't help much. A strict naming convention
\ seems to work best, even when I have to rename incoming O'mail myself.

CAL-4018 also accommodates the task bar better;
I find that this encourages me to use it in full screen mode
instead of half-screen mode.

\ I'm curious regarding what people find so onerous about a full-screen CAL.
\ I keep four programs active at all times...

\ 1. Google's Chrome browser,
\ 2. Paint Shop Pro,
\ 3. Outlook Express Classic (email clone), and
\ 4. The CAL-4700

\ ...I use ALT-TAB to switch between them. The taskbar is hidden all the time.
\ I never find this setup inconvenient.
