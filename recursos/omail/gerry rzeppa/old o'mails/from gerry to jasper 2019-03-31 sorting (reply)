Gerry,

I notice that sorting the root level in the finder
is a no-op/cluck operation.  Ditto for reversing
the sort of the root level in the finder.

Is there a reason for this?
Sorting the drives from A to Z, or from Z to A,
seem like plausible things to do.

\ I don't think there is any technical reason to disallow sorting the root level.
\ As I recall, we just didn't think it worthwhile because:

\ 1. The drives are listed in alphabetical order automatically.
\ 2. Most people only have a few drives connected to their systems.
\ 3. Most drives on most people's systems don't have meaningful names.
\ 4. The drive letters are mutable. Yesterday's E:\ might be today's D:\,
\     depending on how flash drives are popped in and out
\ 5. We wanted the root level to look the same on all the tabs all the time.

\ Gerry
