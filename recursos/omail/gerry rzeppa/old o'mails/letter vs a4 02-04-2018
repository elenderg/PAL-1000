Dear Gerry,

No hurry for A4, but metric is a good starting point for drawing. We're accustomed to.
A letter always can print on A4 scaled up a little or nothing.
I work for Citibank a decade ago and we printed all in letter size. We don't bother.

For the twips, metric units, and compatibility issues: I think that twips could still be the basic units, but metric ones are on top of that,
just as a shell.

Pablo.
