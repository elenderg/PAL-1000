Hey Gerry,

I tested the modifed program "exercise 3" that you emailed me and discovered
that the "convert the string to a number" doesn't return 0 if the string was bad,
but instead returns a number greater than 0.

I have left you the version you sent me, in case you don't have it anymore.
I have modified it to convert the number to string, then wrote it to console
so you can see the results more clearly.

I'm running it with the 4047 build and it's noodle.

No rush on replying, just thought I'd let you know, in case 4047 has either a bug
or if it's just a misunderstanding of it's design.  Either way thanks again for
creating such an amazing language.  I've been having a blast programming small
things to become familar and look forward to the big things in the future.

Take care now and God Bless!

Darin
