The cal-4701 can compile the routine headers for reverse-possessive functions. That is:

to put the center uv a box into a spot:

The testapp directory has a test3 file which illustrates this.

Internally the reverse-possessive definition gets turned into the English form. The above turns into:

put [box] 's center in/into/to [spot]

This allows it to be defined in spanish and used in English as the test illustrates.

I'm working on the calling part now, but it probably won't be done until tomorrow (if everything goes well).
