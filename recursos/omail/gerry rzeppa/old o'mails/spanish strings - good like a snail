Yo, Dahn!

First, regarding this question;

\Is there a better way to do this [compound IF thing with or without partial NOTs], or should the compiler handle this sort of thing?

I don't think there's a better way, at this time, since we would have to make the compiler handle compound IFs
and that would not only make the compiler more complicated, but would also make AND and OR special keywords.
I'm finding, as I try to make the thing work with Spanish, that I only have problems where we do "compiler magic"
such as automatic pluralizing, expansion of things, function-style routines, etc.

Now regarding the string compares:

\They don't use null terminated strings, so they should be fast.

Fast like molasses, maybe. On my machine, compile time for the whole shebang went from an average of 4,500 ms to 14,900 ms.
And the compile time for a tiny program, like your test program (with full noodle, admittedly), more than doubled from 1,218 ms to  2,750 ms.
So I'm going to have to go ahead and ask you to go ahead and see if there's anything you can go ahead and do about that.
Yeah, that would be g...r...e...a...t...

\ Incremental Find

While you're thinking about that, think about this: our Incremental Find doesn't work in Español because hitting, for example,
ALT-0241 to get than funny "ñ," terminates the find. I haven't talked to Pablo about it yet, but I'm thinking of talking him into
not typing funny characters when he's doing a find (and we write an "Unaccent a byte" routine for use in the compares.)

Thanks for your help,

Dahd
