Dear Gerry,

Really interesting the Just-Text software for the Automator.

They sell the PIC already working.

It is a good option for teaching or learning to control with simple orders in plain language.
Software could be simple as you say for translating simple orders.

PS: They are the same for the control circuits for your maze.
