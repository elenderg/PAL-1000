Hi Pablo,

I wasn't clear on my last post. I do need a translation of this record:

Un evento es una cosa con\An event is a thing with
una clase, \A kind,
una bandera mayúsculas, \A shift flag,
una bandera ctrl, \A ctrl flag,
una bandera alt, \An alt flag,
un foco, \A spot, \ mouse location on the screen;  the "spot" type is very basic and is used in a lot of places, so pick a short name that you really like
una tecla, un byte. \A key, a byte.

Thanks,
Gerry
