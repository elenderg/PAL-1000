Querido Gerry:

En un año, ¡van a llegar a la luna!

\Hello, Pablo,

\I'm too excited to translate this letter into Spanish.

\Look in your mailbox here for two new directories:

\sal-1000
\#1 prueba español llano

\The first directory (SAL-1000) is the new Spanish/English development system.
\It is far from complete. It is a little baby boy with a light blue desktop.
\But it is enough, I think, to show that this project is feasible.
\All of the menu items (except for "Ejecutar", shortcut CTRL-E) are still in English.
\All of the error messages are still in English.
\You can compile the SAL-1000 with the CAL-4700, or you can just run the .exe that is in the directory.

\The second directory (#1 prueba español llano) contains my test program.
\You can open and run (ejecutar) it using the SAL-1000.
\Hit the ESC key to quit the test program.
\There are two source files: "el código" and "la biblioteca."
\"El código" is the all-Spanish test code with English comments and remarks.
\"La biblioteca" is a mostly-English but just-enough-Spanish version of the Noodle.

What you two are doing is really amazing!
You started not a week ago and you are now compiling plain Spanish, it is really awesome!

The things to change are obvious details here and there, but come on! This is working!
I need to say it again: you're really awesome!

\Much remains to be done:

\The SAL needs more simple verbs and prepositions.
\The menus need to be translated to Spanish.
\The error messages need to be translated to Spanish.
\More of the Noodle (la biblioteca) needs to be translated to Spanish.

I can do much of this work if you guide me to and give me priorities.

\The whole SAL needs to be translated into Spanish... or maybe not,
\depending on what we're picturing in the long term:

\(a) two separate systems, Plain English and Español Llano; or
\(b) one hybrid system, like the SAL (see remark below);
\(c) something else.

I would choose (b).
Sharing code is the main advantage!
Do you picture a programmer working in his own language but sharing code in an international project?
The future hybrid system could also show the code in English or Spanish on demand.

I tempted to say that a bilingual system is also a plus for the Spanish speaking community because it is always an opportunity to learn English by using Plain English.
It is also a simpler way to go, piece by piece modifying Plain English to accept Spanish as a second language for the code.
CAL and SAL could evolve independently, keeping SAL bilingual.

\The problem with (a) is that English and Spanish code can't be shared.
\The problem with (b) is that the interface and error messages must be either English or Spanish.
\The problem with (c) is that we haven't thought it up yet!

To solve problem with (b): could it be an option in the menus to choose the language for displaying messages and errors?

\Let me know what you think, and may God prosper the work of our hands,
\Gerry

I hope so!

Pablo
