Yo Dan,

I'm working with Pablo in Argentina on Plain Spanish. I think we've made significant progress.

Right now the SAL (Spanish CAL) is bi-lingual; she understands both English and Spanish. At the same time.
My test program, for example, is completely Spanish and looks like this (in a text file called "el código"):

Para correr: \To run:
Puesta en marcha. \ Start up.
Hacer cosas increíbles. \ Do awesome things.
Apagar. \ Shut down.

Para hacer cosas increíbles: \ To do awesome things:
Borrar la pantalla. \ Clear the screen.
Espera la clave de escape. \ Wait for the escape key.

But my Noodle, called "los fideos," has an unholy mixture of the two languages like this:

La clave de escape is a key equal to 27. \ note both languages in a single sentence.

Para espera una clave; \ alternate wording is Spanish
To wait until we hit a key; \ alternet wording is English 
To wait for a key:
Wait for the key to go down. \ routine body is English (for now)
Wait for the key to come up.
Flush all events.

I've only got one big problem (that I know of).
Please call me when you have some time to talk.

Dahd.
