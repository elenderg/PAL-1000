Dear Gerry,

Shortcurt keys are usually the same as in English, except some programs that translate some of them.

CTRL-X para cortar, CTRL-C para copiar, CTRL-V para pegar, y CTRL-Z para deshacer.

We only translate the explanation of the function, rarely the shortcut combination.
I suggest to keep as they are now. May be in the future, we could add some customizing.

Pablo.

PS. I'm with you in this endeavor and I'm glad for that.

\Hello again, Pablo.

\Thanks for the additional input. I'll be writing to you more fully later. But I have a quick interface question.

\In English, we use "shortcut keys" like CTRL-X for cut, CTRL-C for Copy, CTRL-V for past, and CTRL-Z for undo.

\What shortcut keys are normally used in Spanish for commands like these?

\I ask this because it seems that even a bi-lingual compiler has to be mostly English or mostly Spanish from an interface standpoint:
\command names, error messages, documentation, etc, should all be presented, I think, one way or the other.

\Gerry

PS. I'm not giving up. How hard can it be if God gave it to people like us to accomplish?
