Good Gerry:

In Programming Basics for freshmen I ask permission to use "Spanish executable pseudocode". They say yes with the scarce time I have for
main subjects: half semester for flow diagrams with variables, counters, accumulators loops, the other half same subjects in C.

What do you think? Could be an interesting test.

Below, Spanish Menus and shortcuts, those that are the same are on purpose.

Pablo

Dear Pablo:

Below are the 137 lines from the Desktop that install commands on the SAL's menus.
I need your preferred Spanish translations for the command names (the string immediately following the word 'add' in each line).
Some of them have shortcut keys following the command name. These also need to be translated.
Change the command names (and shortcut keys) below, and I'll copy and paste them into el escritorio de la SAL-1002.
The rest of each line should be left in English, at least for now.

If the event's key is the s-key, handle find next; exit.
\If the event's key is the s-key, handle save; exit.
If the event's key is the t-key, handle comment; exit.
If the event's key is the u-key and the current tab's mode is "editor", handle uncomment; exit.
