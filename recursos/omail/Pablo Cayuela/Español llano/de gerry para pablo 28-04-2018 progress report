Dear Papa Pablo,

\ Interesting [teach your kid to read] method.

It's based on the idea that everyone else, as you might expect, does it backwards.
Others start with letters and tell the kid what sounds the letters make.
This is confusing because the letters make different sounds in different contexts.
And it is backwards because they are trying to take the kid from the unknown (the letters) to the known (the sounds).
Our approach takes the kid from the known (the sounds he has been hearing since birth) to the unknown (the various ways of spelling those sounds).

\ And English have some convenience for teaching sentences that make sense with a few words.

Yes, English is a lot more compact than Spanish. But I'm seeing (as I work with the SAL) that Spanish is a much prettier language.
I'm even learning to get my articles and nouns to agree simply by asking myself which choice would "sound better."

The Sal Monet is 99% translated and I'm pleased to say it works!
There are a couple of compiler problems that Dan is helping me fix.
So I need just a few more days to finish it, then I'll send it for you to review.
You will no doubt find a lot of bugs, bad grammar, and poor word choices.
But at least they will be SPANISH bugs, bad SPANISH grammar, and poor SPANISH word choices.

Tu compañero Quijote, Gerry.

PS. Sometimes Google translates "is" as "se" or "está" instead of "es". I'm not sure which one to use.

PPS. Google also pairs "Diga si" with "Di no" instead of "Diga si" / "Diga no". Again, I'm not sure which one to use.
