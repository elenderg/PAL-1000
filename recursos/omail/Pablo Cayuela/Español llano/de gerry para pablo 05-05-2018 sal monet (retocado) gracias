Dear Papa Pablo,

Thank you for the "retouched" version of the Sal Monet 1005.
Those are exactly the kind of corrections/adjustments we need.

I have made a lot of changes since I sent the 1005 to you, however,
so it will take me a day or two to integrate your corrections/adjustments
into the current version (which is now 1009, and will probably be 1010 by the
time Dan gets back to me with the final "big" compiler change).

I think I understand all the changes you've made, and have even anticipated
some of them. "Nula" or "nulo" for "nil", for example. The reason you couldn't find
a definition for "nil" is that it was magically "inherited" from a definition in the
original version of the compiler. Dan has tried to explain it to me several times, but
I still don't understand it myself.

Other corrections, I must admit, should not have been necessary; even I know that it
should be "del evento" and not "de la evento". I'm learning. But I will probably make that
same kind of mistake again.

Here are some of the other changes/improvements that have already been implemented:

- "de" is allowed in names if "de" is not followed by an article, for example "el error de e/s".
- i/o error messages are now in Spanish; the global variable "i/o error" is now called "error de e/s".
- "A spot" is now "un punto" instead of "un foco".
- "Nay sayers" (I like that term) can now be called using "no" BEFORE the verb, for example "Si el trabajo no es completa, salir."
- Decider routines can be terminated with "diga si" or "diga no" or just "di no".
- New local variables can be created "on the fly" when setting a field, for example "Poner 15 mm en la coordenada-y de un punto." (which creates a new local variable of type punto)
- The special, hard-coded fields (target, magnitude and whereabouts) now have Spanish names (objectivo, magnitud, paradero).
- The keywords for loops are now "LAZO, INTERRUMPTIR, SALIR, and REPETIR."
- All the general-purpose Spanish types, globals, and routine headers needed by the Sal Monet have been integrated into the 1008 el seso.
- The simplified color names have been implemented
- The routine that quits a program (and the button that quits the Sal Monet) are both now called "Abandonar", matching the command under the "A" menu.
- "Mayúsculas Todo" and "Minúsculas Todo" now appear after "Mayúscula Inicial" on the "M"  menu.

I'm waiting for Dan to complete the necessary changes to support "function-style" routines, for example...

Para poner el centro de un cuadro en un punto:

...which makes "el centro" look to the programmer like just another field in "un cuadro" record,
and which can be "nested" inside other statements, such as

Dibujar el centro del cuadro con el color rojo.

The compiler makes two calls in a case like this (which is why we need Dan to show us how it is done):

1. A call to the "poner el centro de un cuadro en un punto" function, then
2. A call to the normal "dibujar un punto con un color" routine.

If all goes well, the SAL-1010 should mark the end of major changes to the compiler, with
only changes to el seso and the documentation still to go.

I will send the 1010 to you as soon as Dan is finished and I have made sure his changes work in Spanish.

Tu amigo,

Gerry

PS. Note that "To decide if a counter is past a number" is not just a simple comparison
like "To decide if a counter is greater than a number" since it increments the counter
before checking. So the compound verb "is past" should be special in some way.

PPS. Did you notice that Google is smart enough to handle Spanish subjects in the Sal Monet?
You don't, for example, have to ask it to paint "bananas"; you can ask it to paint "plátanos".

PPPS. How old is Martin now? Is he rolling over? sitting up? learning to type?
