Dear Pablo,

I see you have been working on the documentation.

I hope you didn't misunderstand me when I said, in my previous letter:

(The official "instrucciones" manual will be in the "documentación" directory inside the SAL-1016 directory.)

The version of the instrucciones that matches the code in the SAL-1015 is in the documentación folder
inside the SAL-1015 folder. THAT is the document you should be starting with. It includes all the changes
I made to the 927 headers in the SAL-1015's el Seso, and some other changes, as well.

Gerry
