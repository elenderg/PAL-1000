Mi querido amigo:

\Mi amigo Papa Pablo:
\Please don't feel rushed. This cheetah is not as young as he used to be.
I'll follow your footsteps.

\The honor is mine.
\I guess that makes you "El Primer Caballero de la Orden Osmosiana de los Programadores Español Llano."
\Or do you prefer "El Don Quijote de la Orden Osmosiana de los Programadores Español Llano"?
\Don Quijote is a hero of mine.
¡Seré el Quijote de las Pampas!
\It is a pleasure to help people program in their native tongues. Plain Spanish, Plain French, Plain Italian, Plain Russian, etc,
\were all part of the plan from the start.
And for me you would be the Quixote of the Plains! (pun intended Pampas=Llanos=Plains)

\I'm not in this for the money. This is a labor of love (and hate) for me.
\I hate what the world has done to the simple, easy computers that I loved so much in my youth.
\I love programming in my native tongue with a clean, fast, simple interface.
God leads us along.

\Make all the money you can with it, with just two restrictions:
\1. Don't corrupt it. Keep it clean and fast and simple. No scroll bars!!!
\2. Remember us when you get rich, and send us a few pesos.
You have my word.

\Oh, yeah. And make sure you teach Martin Amin Español Llano BEFORE you teach him C.
\"Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good." Isaiah 7:15.
That's for sure.

\Let us tilt at windmills together, Don Quijote.
D(S)an(cho) and two Quixotes together! Just choose the hulking giant!

\THAT would be an answer to prayer. Sharon has been praying for many years that I might teach Plain English
\in a university setting. Unfortunately, I have no PhD, so that is unlikely. But if YOU can teach Español Llano
\in my place, we will count that as many prayers answered. God is good. He doesn't always answer as expected,
\but He is faithful to answer one way or another.
We take the lead.
I'm not yet a PhD, but in Argentina it is common for Engineers to be professors, and a great opportunity to foster people.

\I've put the SAL-1002 into your mailbox. The menus are in Spanish. The status and error messages are still in English.
\You have to compile it with the SAL-1001, or just run the sal-1002.exe directly with a double-click.
\Try using it to edit the instrucciones and to send text messages. Let me know if you like it.
I'm using SAL everyday since 1001.

\Notes:
\1. I translated "Save All" as "Guardar Todo". I hope this is correct.
Fine.
\2. I translated "Yank" as "Paso", as you suggested.
Good; I forget Yank None -> Paso 0 (zero!)
\3. There were some shortcut key conflicts. And now...
I forget all the shortcuts in my previous answer... sorry. I see that you fixed most.
\4. There is no shortcut for "Group" because "G" is now used for "Guarar". A small inconvenience.
"Group/Agrupa"  could use shortcut "H" - please change in writer "Agrupa" -> "Agrupar" and "Reduce" -> "Reducir vista"
\5. There is no shortcut for "Enlarge" because "E" is now used for "Ejecutar". Not a problem.
"Enlarge/Agranda" could use shortcut "F" - please change "Agranda" -> "Ampliar vista"
\6. There is no shortcut for "Indent" because "I" is now used for "Imprima". Not good for students who want to indent their loops.
Please change "Print/Imprima" -> "Imprimir"
\The available keys are F, H, K, N, and P. How about "N" for "Indent / Más Sangría"?
"Indent / Más Sangría" with "N" ok.
Which function lost its shortcut? To give it the K.

\I think I have all the commands, with proper capitalization, in all the right places.
All right!

\Please review them in (a) finder, (b) editor, (c) writer modes.
\And use the SAL-1002 instead of the CAL-4700, to give it a good workout.
Using it!

\Let me know if we need to make changes.
See a "Send to Back" still under S while "Envía al Fondo" ok under E.

\I have trouble using it because I can't read the menus and I keep hitting the wrong shortcut keys out of habit.
I'm your Spanish eyes.

\Thanks for your help and encouragement. May God establish the work of our hands, Psalm 90:17.
\Gerry
Toda mi admiración para un gran hombre como vos.
Espero aprender de vos.
Un beso para Sharon.

Tu amigo Pablo
