Mi Amigo Pablo,

No hay problema. We will be praying for Martin and for Papá y Mamá.

We are making good progress in the meantime.
Dan and I are getting the Uppercase and Lowercase and and String Compare routines to work properly with accented characters.
And I've got the compiler automatically generating plural type names in Spanish.

Un abrazo,
Gerry

PS. By the way, "maybe" is one word in English.

Dear Gerry,

Forced slowing down...
Martin have some fever after vaccines, a lot of work, travel to another city, family visiting us, father's birthday, etc.
Hope to get back to Español Llano, may be in a few days.

Un abrazo.
Pablo

Dear Pablo,

I haven't heard from you in a few days. Is everything okay?

Gerry
