Querido Gerry:

Last week the battery from my car was stolen and the electrical cables were severed.
I'm reconstructing at slow pace the connections and try to increase security measures at home and in the car.

Soon I hope to go back to the manual de español llano.

Un abrazo grande.
Un beso para toda tu gran familia.

Tu amigo Pablo.
