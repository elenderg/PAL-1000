Dear Pablo,

No hurry necessary. Take your time.
We'll get everything we need, page by page, as we go through the instruction manual.

Let me know if you need help using the Writer. It is not well documented.
Most of the pages in the manual are one big text block with drawings and special text (like colored text) on top of the big block.
So you have to watch where you click, and often you have to click in the margin and "rubber band" the items you want to select.
But don't translate too much too fast, because...

I suspect you'll want the Writer changed to work with metric A4 sheets (instead of "letter" size 8-1/2" x 11").
This is a big deal, believe it or not.
The CAL's fundamental unit is the "twip," which is 1/1440 of an inch.
It's a good system because screen units (based on 96 pixels-per-inch) can be divided evenly using either halves or thirds,
so when we draw on the screen or printer, lines are properly drawn with no rounding errors:

1 inch       1440 twips
1/2 inch     720 twips
1/4 inch     360 twips
1/8 inch     180 twips
1/16 inch     90 twips
1/32 inch     45 twips

1 inch        1440 twips
1/3 inch       480 twips
1/6 inch      240 twips
1/12 inch    120 twips
1/24 inch      60 twips
1/48 inch      30 twips

All of that needs to be re-thought for the conversion to metric units.
And I'm not sure, once such sweeping changes are made, that documents created in
the CAL's Writer will be compatible with the SAL's Writer, and vice-versa.
