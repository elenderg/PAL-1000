If the string is "right-top", put the center's x-coord plus the x-offset and the ellipse's top into the first control spot.
If the string is "right-bottom", put the ellipse's right and the center's y-coord plus the y-offset into the first control spot.
If the string is "left-bottom", put the center's x-coord minus the x-offset and the ellipse's bottom into the first control spot.
\ control point 2
If the string is "left-top", put the center's x-coord minus the x-offset and the ellipse's top into a second control spot.
If the string is "right-top", put the ellipse's right and the center's y-coord minus the y-offset into the second control spot.
If the string is "right-bottom", put the center's x-coord plus the x-offset and the ellipse's bottom into the second control spot.
If the string is "left-bottom", put the ellipse's left and the center's y-coord plus the y-offset into the second control spot.
\ ending point
If the string is "left-top", put the ellipse's left plus the half width and the ellipse's top into an ending spot.
