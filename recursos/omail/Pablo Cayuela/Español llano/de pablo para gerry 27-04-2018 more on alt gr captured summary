Dear Gerry,

\Dear Pablo,
\\I don't have the broken bar in the keyboard, I never needed as such.
\It is not on the English keyboad either.
Ok.

\\The Ancient-SCII for Spanish is not the one you choose. In US keyboards with MS DOS till 6  and followed Windows we have to type Alt+numpad numbers different 
\\from your chosen ASCII in manual for CAL.
\I do not know how to fix that. The glyph/number relationship is hard-coded in the Osmosian font file.
\I think the Osmosian font is consistent with standard Windows fonts, however.
\When I use Window's Charmap program to look at, say, the Osmosian font and the Courrier New font, the first 256 glyphs look the same.
\Is this a problem?
Not a problem, just a comment on many Standards and one chosen.

\\What a nightmare [is Windows]!
\Indeed. That's why we worked so hard to hide all the ugliness with the CAL.

\\Well, they {Microsoft, Windows] are really behemoths. Right target for Quixotes.
\I agree. Hard to miss a "windmill" that big!
\In defense of Microsoft and Windows, however, I must praise them for keeping at least the bottom level of the thing stable.
\That is what allows us to run a CAL written in 2006 for Windows XP on a computer in 2018 using Windows 10.
So good!

\I've talked with many programmers over the years, and those brought up in the "C" tradition simply don't think
\in the same way as those brought up in the Pascal tradition. Different brain wiring, I suppose.
I guess.

\\ "lo" is unique, non plural form. It is not neccessary in our expressions for programming.
\Genesis 11:6-7: "And the Lord said, Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."
\It's a good thing that the SAL and I can treat "blah, blah, LO, blah, blah" and just "blah, blah, DEFINITE ARTICLE, blah, blah".
Right, that's enough.

\\You do master English, a collection of exceptions!
\True, but I started the day I was born.
Right, the same for me with Spanish.

\\And you coded them in the CAL; Spanish is similar to English in that; we have plenty of rules, and a lot of exceptions too.
\\For the evolving code of SAL, it will have the same pattern as the CAL, some rules and some exceptions.
\Yes. That's why I want to get the Sal Monet working - so I can better understand where the exceptions are.
\Then we can start chipping away at the exceptions to make the SAL as natural as we can.
I got it.

\\You're not a dog, you're a cheetah.
\I may have been, long ago. Now I'm not so sure.
And old cheetah if you prefered it.

\See the page from our RhymingReader.com "teach your kid to read" course that I put in your mailbox.
Interesting method. And English have some convenience for teaching sentences that make sense with a few words.

\Tu compañero Quijote, Gerry.

Tu compañero Quijote, Pablo.
