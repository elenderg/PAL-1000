Dear Gerry,

\Dear Pablo,
\\I'm working with modified SAL-1004.
\Great!

\\The only thing that I could say, is that you do not design it as a broken but as a solid vertical bar.
\We have the vertical bar ( | ) as Alt + 0124 and the broken bar ( ¦ ) at Alt + 0166.
\Windows must translate your broken bar key to 124.
Oh, I see, there are two bars. And you do have the two shapes and codes.
I don't have the broken in the keyboard, I never needed as such; but some programs mistakes the solid in the keyboard
by the broken in the screen.

\Actually, I think the problem is that the "extended ASCII table" is not well-defined.
\Codes 0 - 128 are consistent, but there are different "standards" for the "extended ACSII codes" 128-255.
Yes indeed!
The Ancient-SCII for Spanish is not the one you choose. In US keyboards with MS DOS till 6  and followed Windows we have to type Alt+numpad numbers different 
from your chosen ASCII in manual for CAL.

\Joke: The great thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from :)
I've been laughing out loud with this.

\It's a very goofy process. There are two event (message) queues: our simple one, and Windows' complicated one.
\Ours has just 10 event kinds, while Windows' has hundreds (maybe thousands) of them.
\(See https://wiki.winehq.org/List_Of_Windows_Messages.)
What a nightmare!
I never knew Windows in such deep as you do.

\Goofy, goofy, goofy. But that's how Microsoft wants it done.
Well, they're really behemoths. Right target for Quixotes.

\Sometimes I think C programmers actually LIKE things to be obscure, obtuse, and unnecessarily difficult.
First time I've learnt C, I thought "what an originality to do this that way...!" but then I never could manage to master all of its intricacies,
nor all of its criptic notation for everything, its flaw pointer unmanageability, its primitivity.
And on and on never could teach the whole nor the essence of C. There is none.
I love the simplicity of Oberon, even many Pascal flavors.
I hate the messy of object orientation. Love Structured Programming.
Even Relational Model have some structureness that unix/linux/C-C++ doesn't have.

\\Sorry querido gringo, I misleading you somewhat:
\\el/los: masc., sing. and plural respectively. 
\\la/las: fem., sing. and plural respectively. 
\\lo: neutral singular for special sentences not usual ones.

\\Some examples:
\\art. + noun 
\\sm: El evento. The event.
\\pm: Los eventos. The events.
\\By the way: el seso (the brain) -> los sesos (the brains)

\Ah! That helps.

\\sf: La tecla. The key.
\\pf: Las teclas. The keys.

\That helps, too.

\\sn + m: Lo blanco de tu cara. The whiteness of your face.
\\sn + f: ¡Lo blanca que es la leche! How white is the milk!

\That is less helpful. What's the plural form of "lo"?
Dear Gerry, "lo" is unique, non plural form. It is not neccessary in our expressions for programming.

\\art. + noun + adj.: the three need to match in gender and number. You could see the regularity of plural cases.

\\sm: -o: El evento último. The last event.
\\sf: -a: La tecla última. The last key.

\\sm: -os: Los eventos últimos. The last events.
\\sf: -as: Las teclas últimas. The last keys.

\So "últim" can be either masculine or feminine?

\\Now with an adj. of neutral gender

\\pm: -o -e: El evento reciente.The recent event.
\\pf: -a -e: La tecla reciente. The recent key.

\\pm: -os -es: Los eventos recientes.The recent events.
\\pf: -as -es: Las teclas recientes. The recent keys.

\I'm beginning to think I'm too old for this.
No, you don't. You do master English, a collection of exceptions!
And you coded them in the CAL; Spanish is similar to English in that; we have plenty of rules, and a lot of exceptions too.
I guess that you have more, especially in spelling and pronounciation.
For the evolving code of SAL, it will have the same pattern as the CAL, some rules and some exceptions.

\\But watch out! Nouns ending in -e, have no clear rule:

\\Masculinos:
\\el hombre, el cable, el aire, etc.: the man, the cable, the air.
\\los hombres, los cables, los aires: the men, the cables, the airs.

\\Femeninos:
\\la cumbre, la pirámide, la serie, etc.: the summit, the pyramid, a (or the) series 
\\las cumbres, la pirámides, las series: the summit, the pyramids, the series

\I will keep trying, but in English we say, "It is hard to teach an old dog new tricks."
Really funny.
You're not a dog, you're a cheetah.

Your not so young companion Quixote, Pablo.
