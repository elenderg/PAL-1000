A city is a thing with a number, a spot and a visited flag.
A nearest neighbor is a city.

To create some cities:
Put 5 into a number.
Make a box 1 inch smaller than the screen's box.
Loop.
Pick a spot anywhere in the box.
Allocate memory for a city.
Put the spot into the city's spot.
Append the city to the cities.
Subtract 1 from the number. If the number is 0, break.
Repeat.
Put 1 into the cities' first's number.

To arrange some cities for a travelling salesman (nearest neighbor algorithm):
Get a city from the cities.
If the city is nil, break.
Set the city's visited flag.
Find a nearest neighbor to the city in the cities.
If the nearest neighbor is nil, break.
Remove the nearest neighbor from the cities.
Insert the nearest neighbor into the cities after the city.
Repeat.
Number the cities.
Draw the cities.

To find a nearest neighbor to a current city in some cities:
Void the nearest neighbor.
Put the largest number into a shortest distance.
Loop.
Get a city from the cities.
If the city is nil, break.
If the city is the current city, repeat.
If the city's visited flag is set, repeat.
Get a distance between the city and the current city.
If the distance is not less than the shortest distance, repeat.
Put the distance into the shortest distance.
Put the city into the nearest neighbor.
Repeat.

To get a distance between a spot and another spot (minkowski):
Put the spot's x minus the other spot's x into a number.
De-sign the number.
Put the spot's y minus the other spot's y into another number.
De-sign the other number.
Put the number plus the other number into the distance.
