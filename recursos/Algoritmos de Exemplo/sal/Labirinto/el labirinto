A maze is a thing with a width, a height, a cell size and some cells.
 
A cell is a thing with a box, a left flag, a top flag, a right flag, a bottom flag, a visited flag, a start flag and an end flag.
 
A neighbor is a cell.
 
To run:
Start up.
Clear the screen with the tan color.
Create a maze 8 inches by 4 inches using 1/4 inch for the cells. \ blog article uses 10 by 8 and 1/4 inch -- changed for speed and wide screens in this version
Display the maze with title and instructions.
Destroy the maze.
Wait for the escape key.
Shut down.
 
To create a maze a width by a height using a size for the cells:
Allocate memory for the maze.
Put the width into the maze's width.
Put the height into the maze's height.
Put the size into the maze's cell size.
Create some cells for the maze.
Apply the Aldous-Broder algorithm to the maze.
Select starting and ending cells in the maze.
 
To create some cells for a maze:
If a spot's left is greater than the maze's width, break.
If the spot's top is greater than the maze's height,
Add the maze's cell size to the spot's left; repeat.
Create a cell of the maze's cell size at the spot.
Append the cell to the maze's cells.
Add the maze's cell size to the spot's left.
If the spot's left is less than the maze's width, repeat.
Put 0 into the spot's left.
Add the maze's cell size to the spot's top.
Repeat.
 
To create a cell of a size at a spot:
Allocate memory for the cell.
Put the spot and the spot plus the size into the cell's box.
Set the cell's left flag.
Set the cell's top flag.
Set the cell's right flag.
Set the cell's bottom flag.
Clear the cell's visited flag.
 
To apply the Aldous-Broder algorithm to a maze:
Pick a cell in the maze. Set the cell's visited flag.
Loop.
If all of the maze's cells have been visited, break.
Pick a neighbor of the cell in the maze.
If the neighbor's visited flag is not set,
connect the cell with the neighbor.
Set the neighbor's visited flag.
Put the neighbor into the cell.
Repeat.
 
To pick a neighbor of a cell in a maze:
Void the neighbor.
Loop.
Pick a number between 1 and 4.
If the number is 1,
find the neighbor above the cell in the maze.
If the number is 2,
find the neighbor to the right of the cell in the maze.
If the number is 3,
find the neighbor below the cell in the maze.
If the number is 4,
find the neighbor to the left of the cell in the maze.
If the neighbor is nil, repeat.
 
To find a neighbor above a cell in a maze:
Void the neighbor.
Loop.
Get the neighbor from the maze's cells.
If the neighbor is the cell, repeat.
If the neighbor is nil, break.
If the neighbor's bottom line is the cell's top line, break.
Repeat.
 
To connect a cell with a neighbor:
If the cell's top line is the neighbor's bottom line,
clear the cell's top flag;
clear the neighbor's bottom flag; exit.
If the cell's right line is the neighbor's left line,
clear the cell's right flag;
clear the neighbor's left flag; exit.
If the cell's bottom line is the neighbor's top line,
clear the cell's bottom flag;
clear the neighbor's top flag; exit.
If the cell's left line is the neighbor's right line,
clear the cell's left flag;
clear the neighbor's right flag; exit.
 
To decide if all of some cells have been visited:
Get a cell from the cells.
If the cell is nil, say yes.
If the cell's visited flag is not set, say no.
Repeat.
 
To select starting and ending cells in a maze:
Set the maze's cells' first's start flag.
Set the maze's cells' last's end flag.
Loop.
Pick a cell in the maze.
If the cell's start flag is set, repeat.
If the cell's end flag is set, repeat.
Add 1 to a count. If the count is greater than 14, break.
If the count is odd, set the cell's start flag; repeat.
If the count is even, set the cell's end flag; repeat.
 
To draw some cells:
Get a cell from the cells.
If the cell is nil, break.
Draw the cell with the black pen.
Repeat.
Refresh the screen.
 
To draw a cell with a pen:
If the cell's left flag is set,
draw the cell's left line with the pen.
If the cell's top flag is set,
draw the cell's top line with the pen.
If the cell's right flag is set,
draw the cell's right line with the pen.
If the cell's bottom flag is set,
draw the cell's bottom line with the pen.
Put the cell's width divided by 3 into a width.
If the cell's start flag is set,
draw a dot the width wide at the cell's box's center with the dark green pen.
If the cell's end flag is set,
draw another dot the width wide at the cell's box's center with the dark red pen.
 
To pick a cell in a maze:
Pick a number between 1 and the maze's cells' count.
Void the cell.
Loop.
Get the cell from the maze's cells.
If the cell is nil, break.
Add 1 to a count. If the count is the number, break.
Repeat.

To clear the screen with a color:
Draw the screen's box with the color and the color.
Refresh the screen.
 
To decide if a line is another line:
If the line's start is not the other line's start, say no.
If the line's end is not the other line's end, say no.
Say yes.
 
To find a neighbor to the right of a cell in a maze:
Void the neighbor.
Loop.
Get the neighbor from the maze's cells.
If the neighbor is the cell, repeat.
If the neighbor is nil, break.
If the neighbor's left line is the cell's right line, break.
Repeat.
 
To find a neighbor below a cell in a maze:
Void the neighbor.
Loop.
Get the neighbor from the maze's cells.
If the neighbor is the cell, repeat.
If the neighbor is nil, break.
If the neighbor's top line is the cell's bottom line, break.
Repeat.
 
To find a neighbor to the left of a cell in a maze:
Void the neighbor.
Loop.
Get the neighbor from the maze's cells.
If the neighbor is the cell, repeat.
If the neighbor is nil, break.
If the neighbor's right line is the cell's left line, break.
Repeat.
 
To display a maze with title and instructions:
Clear the screen with the tan color.
Draw the maze in the screen's box with title and instructions.
 
To draw a maze in a box with title and instructions:
Center the maze in the box.
Put the maze's box into a title box.
Move the title box up 3/4 inch.
Put the title box's top plus 1/2 inch into the title box's bottom.
Put "osmosian" and 1/2 inch into a font.
Draw "MultiMaze" in the title box with the font and "center".
Put the maze's box into an instructions box.
Move the instructions box down 3/8 inch.
Put the instructions box's bottom minus 1/4 inch into the instructions box's top.
Put "osmosian" and 1/4 inch into the font.
Draw "Connect each green dot with one red dot.  Use each dot only once.  It's okay to re-use a path." in the instructions box with the font and "center".
Draw the maze's cells.
 
To center a maze in a box:
Zero the maze.
Put the box's width minus the maze's width divided by 2 into a pair's x-number.
Put the box's height minus the maze's height divided by 2 into the pair's y-number.
Loop.
Get a cell from the maze's cells.
If the cell is nil, break.
Move the cell's box given the pair.
Repeat.
 
To zero a maze:
Put the maze's cells' first's box's left-top into a pair.
Negate the pair.
Loop.
Get a cell from the maze's cells.
If the cell is nil, break.
Move the cell's box given the pair.
Repeat.
 
To put a maze's box into a box:
Put the maze's cells' first's box's left-top in the box's left-top.
Put the maze's cells' last's box's right-bottom in the box's right-bottom.
