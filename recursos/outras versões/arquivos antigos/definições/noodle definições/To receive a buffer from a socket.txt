To receive a buffer from a socket:
Clear the i/o error.
Clear the buffer.
Put 8 kilobytes into a buffer size.
Loop.
Put 0 into a size. 
Put the buffer's length into a saved length.
Reassign the buffer's first given the saved length plus the buffer size.
Put the buffer's first plus the saved length into a  pointer.
Call "ws2_32.dll" "recv" with the socket and the pointer and the buffer size and 0 returning a count.
If the count is not -1 [socket_error], put the pointer plus the count minus 1 into the buffer's last; exit.
If the system's last winsock error is not 10040 [wsamsgsize], put "Error receiving data." into the i/o error; clear the buffer; exit.
Put the pointer plus the count minus 1 into the buffer's last.
Repeat.
