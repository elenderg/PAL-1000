To convert a string to a number:
Put 0 into the number.
Slap a substring on the string.
If the substring is blank, exit.
If the substring's first's target is any sign, add 1 to the substring's first.
Loop.
If the substring is blank, break.
Multiply the number by 10.
Put the substring's first's target into another number.
Subtract 48 from the other number.
Add the other number to the number.
Add 1 to the substring's first.
Repeat.
If the string's first's target is the dash byte, negate the number.
