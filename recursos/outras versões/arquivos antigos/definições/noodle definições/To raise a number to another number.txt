To raise a number to another number:
If the other number is 0, put 1 into the number; exit.
If the other number is less than 0, put 0 into the number; exit. \ should be 1/the raised result, but always comes out 0 with numbers
Put 1 into a result number.
Loop.
If a counter is past the other number, break.
Multiply the result by the number.
Repeat.
Put the result into the number.
