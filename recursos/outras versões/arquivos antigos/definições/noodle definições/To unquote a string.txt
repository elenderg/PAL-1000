To unquote a string:
Slap a substring on the string.
If the substring is blank, break.
If the substring's first's target is not the double-quote byte, exit.
Add 1 to the substring's first.
Loop.
If the substring is blank, break.
If the substring's first is the substring's last, break.
Append the substring's first's target to another string.
If the substring's first's target is the double-quote byte, add 1 to the substring's first.
Add 1 to the substring's first.
Repeat.
Put the other string into the string.
