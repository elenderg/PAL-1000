To split a string into a left substring and a right substring given a separator byte:
Clear the left.
Clear the right.
If the string is blank, exit.
Put the string's first into a substring's first.
Put the substring's first minus 1 into the substring's last.
Loop.
If the substring's last is greater than the string's last, exit.
Add 1 to the substring's last.
If the substring's last's target is the separator byte, break.
Repeat.
Put the substring's first into the left's first.
Put the substring's last minus 1 into the left's last.
Put the substring's last plus 1 into the right's first.
Put the string's last into the right's last.
