To rename a path to another path in the file system:
Privatize the path.
Remove any trailing backslash from the path.
Null terminate the path.
Privatize the other path.
Remove any trailing backslash from the other path.
Null terminate the other path.
Call "kernel32.dll" "MoveFileA" with the path's first and the other path's first returning a number.
Clear the i/o error.
If the number is not 0, exit.
Put "Error renaming file '" then the path then "'." into the i/o error.
