To read stdin into a buffer:
Clear the i/o error.
Clear the buffer.
Find a string given the environment variables and "CONTENT_LENGTH".
If the string is blank, put "Error getting content_length" into the i/o error; exit.
Convert the string into a length.
If the length is 0, exit.
Reassign the buffer's first given the length.
Call "kernel32.dll" "ReadFile" with the stdin handle and the buffer's first and the length and a number's whereabouts and nil.
If the number is not the length, put "Error reading stdin data" into the i/o error; clear the buffer; exit.
Put the buffer's first plus the length minus 1 into the buffer's last.
