To scan a type given a rider (unit of measure):
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Convert the rider's token to the type's scale.
If the type's scale is 0, abort with "Zero is an invalid scale." and the type's locus; exit.
Move the rider (compiler rules).
Scan the type's base name given the rider.
If the rider's token is not the period byte, abort with "Types need to end with a period, I found '" then the rider's token then "'." and the rider; exit.
Move the rider (compiler rules).
Index the type.
