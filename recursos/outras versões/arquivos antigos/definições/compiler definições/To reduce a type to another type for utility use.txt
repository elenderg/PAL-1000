To reduce a type to another type for utility use:
Put the type into the other type.
Loop.
If the other type is nil, exit.
If the other type's name is "hex string", exit.
If the other type's name is "string", exit.
If the other type's name is "number", exit.
If the other type's name is "pointer", exit.
If the other type's name is "thing", void the other type; exit.
If the other type's base type is the other type, void the other type; exit.
Put the other type's base type into the other type.
Repeat.
