To transmogrify a fragment (save eax):
Attach address loading code to the fragment's code given the fragment's variable. \ put address into edx
If the fragment's variable is nil, abort with "Internal error - transmogrify a fragment (save eax)"; exit.
If the fragment's variable's type is nil, abort with "Internal error 2 - transmogrify a fragment (save eax)"; exit.
Put the fragment's variable's type's length into a length.
If the length is 4, attach $8902 to the fragment's code; exit. \ mov [edx],eax
If the length is 2, attach $668902 to the fragment's code; exit. \ mov [edx],ax
If the length is 1, attach $8802 to the fragment's code; exit. \ mov [edx],al
Abort with "Internal error 3 - transmogrify a fragment (save eax)".
