To compile a term given a rider (common part):
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the rider's token is the dash byte, compile the term given the rider (negated term); exit.
If the rider's token is the cross byte, compile the term given the rider (posigated term); exit.
If the rider's token is the start of any variable, compile the term given the rider (variable); exit.
If the rider's token is the start of any new local, compile the term given the rider (new local); exit.
If the rider's token is any literal, compile the term given the rider (literal); exit.
Abort with "I expected a term hereabouts but all I found was '" then the rider's token then "'." and the rider.
