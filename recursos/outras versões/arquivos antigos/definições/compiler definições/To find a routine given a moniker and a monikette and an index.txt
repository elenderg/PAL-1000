If the monikette is nil, exit.
Void the routine.
Privatize the moniker.
Put the monikette's type into the monikette's current type.
Slap the monikette's current substring on the monikette's string.
Loop.
Append the monikette to the moniker (while bubbling).
Find a refer given the moniker and the index.
If the refer is not nil, put the refer's pointer into the routine.
If the refer is not nil, find the routine given the moniker and the monikette's next and the index.
If the routine is not nil, break.
