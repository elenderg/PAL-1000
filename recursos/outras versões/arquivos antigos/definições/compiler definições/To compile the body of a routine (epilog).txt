To compile the body of a routine (epilog):
If the routine is nil, exit.
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Add a fragment given the finalize tag.
Loop.
Get a variable from the routine's locals.
If the variable is nil, break.
If the variable's kind is "scratch", repeat.
If the variable's type should not be finalized, repeat.
Add another fragment given the push address tag and the variable.
Find another routine given "~finalize" and the variable's type.
If the other routine is nil, abort with "Internal error - compile the body of a routine (epilog)"; exit.
Add a third fragment given the call internal tag and the other routine.
Repeat.
Add a fourth fragment given the epilog tag.
