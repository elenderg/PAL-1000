To compile the next statement given a rider (say):
If the current routine's decider flag is not set, compile the next statement given the rider (call - internal); exit.
Move the rider (compiler rules).
Compile an expression given the rider.
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the expression's variable is nil, abort with "Invalid 'say', I don't understand the variable '" then the expression's phrase then "'." and the rider; exit.
If the expression's type cannot be reduced to "flag", abort with "I need a definite 'yes' or 'no' here." and the rider; exit.
Add a fragment given the load eax tag and the expression's variable.
Add another fragment given the exit tag.
