To resolve a global:
If the global is nil, exit.
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the global's global body is not blank, resolve the global (compile body).
If the global's type name is blank, abort with "Invalid global '" then the global's name then "'." and the global's locus; exit.
Resolve the global as a variable.
