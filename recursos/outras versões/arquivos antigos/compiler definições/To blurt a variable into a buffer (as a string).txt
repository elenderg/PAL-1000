To blurt a variable into a buffer (as a string):
Put the variable's address minus the image base into an address.
Put the variable's data's length into a length.
Put the address into another address.
Add a prototype string's magnitude to the other address.
Add the image base to the other address.
Put 0 into the prototype string's first.
Put -1 into the prototype string's last.
If the length is not 0, put the other address into the prototype string's first.
If the length is not 0, put the prototype string's first plus the length minus 1 into the prototype string's last.
Blurt bytes given the prototype string's whereabouts and the prototype string's magnitude and the buffer and the address.
Add the prototype string's magnitude to the address.
Blurt the variable's data into the buffer at the address.
