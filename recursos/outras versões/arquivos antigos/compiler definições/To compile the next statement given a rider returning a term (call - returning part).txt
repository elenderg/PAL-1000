To compile the next statement given a rider returning a term (call - returning part):
Move the rider (compiler rules).
Compile the term given the rider.
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the term's variable is nil, abort with "I don't understand the variable '" then the term's phrase then "'." and the rider; exit.
If the term's type is not value pushable, abort with "A simple 1, 2, or 4-byte variable is required in the 'returning' clause." and the rider.
