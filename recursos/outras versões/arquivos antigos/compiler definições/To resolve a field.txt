To resolve a field:
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the field is nil, exit.
Resolve the field as a variable.
If the field's nickname is not any valid field name, clear the field's nickname.
If the field's name is not any valid field name, abort with "'" then the field's name then "' is not a valid field name." and the field's locus; exit.
