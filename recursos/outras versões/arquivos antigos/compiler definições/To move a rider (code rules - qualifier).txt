To move a rider (code rules - qualifier):
If the rider's source is blank, exit.
If the rider's source's first's target is the return byte, break.
If the rider's source's first's target is the left-paren byte, add 1 to a count.
If the rider's source's first's target is the right-paren byte, subtract 1 from the count.
Bump the rider.
If the count is 0, break.
Repeat.
