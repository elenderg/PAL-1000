To handle print:
If the current tab's mode is "editor", handle print given the current tab's node's source; exit.
If the current tab's mode is "docster", handle print given the current tab's node's document; exit.
If the current tab's mode is "writer", handle print given the current tab's node's page; exit.
Cluck.
