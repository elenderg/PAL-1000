To smooth a polygon:
If the polygon is nil, exit.
If the polygon's vertices' count is less than 3, exit.
If the polygon is closed, append the polygon's first vertex's next's spot to the polygon; set a flag.
Put the polygon's first vertex into a left vertex.
Loop.
If the left vertex's next is nil, break.
Put the left vertex's next into a right vertex.
Get a center spot given the left vertex's spot and the right vertex's spot.
Insert the center into the polygon after the left vertex.
Put the left vertex's next into a new vertex.
If the left vertex's previous is nil, put the right vertex into the left vertex; repeat.
Get another center spot given the left vertex's previous' spot and the new vertex's spot.
Get a difference between the other center and the left vertex's spot.
Divide the difference by 2.
Add the difference to the left vertex's spot.
Put the right vertex into the left vertex.
Repeat.
If the flag is not set, exit.
Destroy the polygon's first vertex given the polygon.
Destroy the polygon's last vertex given the polygon.
