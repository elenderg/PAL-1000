To put a polygon's box into a box:
If the polygon is nil, zero the box; exit.
If the polygon's vertices are empty, zero the box; exit.
Put the largest number and the largest number and the smallest number and the smallest number into the box.
Loop.
Get a vertex from the polygon's vertices.
If the vertex is nil, break.
If the vertex's x is less than the box's left, put the vertex's x into the box's left.
If the vertex's y is less than the box's top, put the vertex's y into the box's top.
If the vertex's x is greater than the box's right, put the vertex's x into the box's right.
If the vertex's y is greater than the box's bottom, put the vertex's y into the box's bottom.
Repeat.
