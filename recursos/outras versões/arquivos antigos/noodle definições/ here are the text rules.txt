\ here are the text rules:
\   in a non-wrapped text, the rows end with a return byte.
\   in a wrapped text, the rows end with either a return byte or a space.
\   when text is converted to a string, linefeed bytes are added after return bytes.
\   when a string is converted to text, linefeed bytes are removed.
\   there is always at least one row.
\   there is always a return byte at the end of the last row.
