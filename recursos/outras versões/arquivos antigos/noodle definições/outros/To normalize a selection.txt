To normalize a selection:
If the selection's anchor row# is less than the selection's caret row#, exit.
If the selection's anchor row# is greater than the selection's caret row#, swap the selection's anchor with the selection's caret; exit.
If the selection's anchor column# is greater than the selection's caret column#, swap the selection's anchor column# with the selection's caret column#.
