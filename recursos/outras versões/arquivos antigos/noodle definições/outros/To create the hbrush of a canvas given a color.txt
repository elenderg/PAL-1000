To create the hbrush of a canvas given a color:
Convert the color to a colorref.
If the color is clear, put the null hbrush into an hbrush.
If the color is not clear, call "gdi32.dll" "CreateSolidBrush" with the colorref returning the hbrush.
Call "gdi32.dll" "SelectObject" with the canvas and the hbrush.
