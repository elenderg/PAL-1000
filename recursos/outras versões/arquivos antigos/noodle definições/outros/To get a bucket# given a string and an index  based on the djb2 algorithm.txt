To get a bucket# given a string and an index: \ based on the djb2 algorithm
\  if the index is nil, put 0 into the bucket#; exit. \ to make compiler faster
Put the string's length into the bucket#.
If the bucket# is 0, exit.
Add 5381 to the bucket#.
Slap a substring on the string.
Loop.
Put the substring's first's target into a byte.
Lowercase the byte.
Put the bucket# into a number.
Shift the bucket# left 5 bits.
Add the number to the bucket#.
Add the byte to the bucket#.
Add 3 to the substring's first.
If the substring is blank, break.
Repeat.
Bitwise and the bucket# with the largest number.
Divide the bucket# by the index's bucket count giving a quotient and the bucket#.
