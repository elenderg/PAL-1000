Gerry,

This O'Mail is delightful!

There is an old saying that
"every Unix program grows until it can send mail."
By that standard, Plain English has arrived.
(And possibly has reached completion.)

\ We're all on the "honor system" here.
O'Mail has exactly the same amount of security that
MIT's original hacking labs had.  (None, of course.)
Sadly, I was not around to see them, but I had the
blessing to work with some of the hackers who were
a part of that culture.

Congratulations to you and Pablo on figuring out a way
to bootstrap a full-featured version of CAL into Spanish.
(And here I thought "bootstrapping a full-featured version"
 was an oxymoron!)

I am sure there is a lot of work left to do,
but in some ways it is already ahead of Microsoft's
Spanish support.  When I worked with Microsoft's Cortana team
a couple years ago, they had deliberately told Cortana
to be ignorant of accent marks.  I don't know if they
have since retrofitted them.

Has Pablo figured out how to make SAL conjugate verbs?
Has he decided whether SAL is formal or informal?
And will SAL be happy with Spanish typed with a Southern accent?
For example, Google thinks that the formal imperative
singular form of "eligir" is "elija".  According to 
https://www.spanishconjugation.net/imperative-command/elegir/
the informal imperative singular is "elija".
The formal imperative plural is "elijan".

Spanish has its own Southern accent.
It is used in Chile, Argentina, and southern Spain.
It has an informal second person plural.
"Vosotros" is the pronoun that corresponds to "Y'all".
The Mexicans I know are completely unaware of this pronoun
and its conjugation.  ("¡Vosotros elegid!" means "Y'all draw!")

I look forward to verifying CAL-40xx's compatibility with
CAL-4707.  Are there any gotchas I should be aware of?
