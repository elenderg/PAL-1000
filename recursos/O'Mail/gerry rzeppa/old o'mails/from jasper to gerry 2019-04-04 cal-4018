Gerry,

I have released the CAL-4018 in "O:\jasper paulsen\cal-4018\",
and on GitHub, in "https://github.com/Folds/english".

As usual, "O:\jasper paulsen\cal-4018\" is set up so that
the program can be compiled using any CAL-40xx or CAL-4700.

CAL-4018 has some modest changes:

 * The turtle can now
   "fade a line a length long from a color to another color".
 * The finder can now be refreshed, and sort by date.
   It can also sort, reverse, and refresh the root node.
 * The window shape now accommodates the taskbar shape
   as of when the program started up.  In the switch,
   the active tab is filleted.

If you have any potential users who are interested in
Plain English Programming, but are intimidated by
CAL-4700's user interface, CAL-4018 might be a good match
for them.
