Compañero Quijote:

\Thanks, Pablo.
\You are helping very much and saving me a LOT of tedious work.
We're together in this endeavour.

\I've got the colors and the keys in the SAL-1004 now. When we get those ASCII "byte" variables in there,
\(and I do a little more testing) I will post a copy of the SAL-1004 and will start working on the SAL-1005.
I could do some of the tests if you guide me to, it would be more natural for me walking around SAL-1004.

\I was able to get the "full spanish" versions of the keys to work...
\\all Spanish version: \La tecla-a es una tecla igual a 65.
\...including the "a". But only because "EQUAL TO" is a special case; "a" as a preposition, in general, is still a problem.
I'm only pointing that for an only Spanish SAL.

\Now to answer your questions:

\\The Ñ/ñ is working in CAL and SAL, how is this possible? I can't find the code in the Noodle.
\I don't know what you mean by "working".
I mean that every time I press the Ñ/ñ key is written on screen in S/CAL but I can't found the code in Noodle for recognizing that key on the keyboard.
How is it working?

\Versions prior to the SAL-1004 should see "ñ" as not equal to "Ñ".
\And the incremental find (CTRL-B) should get interrupted if you press the ALT key to type ALT-0241, for example.
\But it's better (I think) in the SAL-1004.
You're right indeed, when I search I could find either the big or the little only if I write the same in find.

\\Name is "eñe" in Spanish, but could be n-tilde or n-virgulilla for the hybrid SAL.
\Whichever one you like. After all, you know what sounds "natural" in Spanish; I have no idea.
It was only a comment.

\\By the way, in CAL/SAL I never could use the keys that have a third symbol, such as backslash \, left/right brackets [ ],
\\l/r braces { }, pipe |, at @, hash #, tilde ~, euro €‚¬, not-sign ¬, because all of this both in Spanish and Latin American keyboards
\\works in combination and after releasing the key ALT GRAPHIC (in place of the right ALT). Please, check an image of that keyboards.
\\When I need one of that symbols in CAL/SAL, I always copied from previous written texts.

\That is a problem. We will have to fix that. Somehow. Is this what your keyboard looks like?

At work we have many of them, that's Latin American or Spanish variant; I have another (International) Spanish keyboard in my home laptop.

In either one, it is needed to press the ALT GR + the key with a third symbol at the bottom right of the key to get it on screen after release.
This method is almost universal for every keyboard for other languages or countries, besides changing physical layout for other symbols.

One more question:
La tecla limpiar es una tecla equal to 12. \ clear key = limpiar? 
I can't find the clear key.

Tu compañero Quijote.
