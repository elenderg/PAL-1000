\ I don't think there is any technical reason to disallow sorting the root level.
\ As I recall, we just didn't think it worthwhile because:

\ 1. The drives are listed in alphabetical order automatically.
\ 2. Most people only have a few drives connected to their systems.
\ 3. Most drives on most people's systems don't have meaningful names.
\ 4. The drive letters are mutable. Yesterday's E:\ might be today's D:\,
\     depending on how flash drives are popped in and out
\ 5. We wanted the root level to look the same on all the tabs all the time.

Gerry,

Thanks for the insight.

In CAL-4018, I will allow sorting, reversing, and refreshing
the root-level node.  This change will make this part of the UI
consistent with the UI for lower-level directories;
it also makes the code a few lines shorter.
