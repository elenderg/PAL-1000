Querido Gerry:

\Querido Pablo:

\Cinco cosas:

\1. Google translate sometimes puts the adjective before the noun, sometimes after:

\el primer número
\el segundo número
\el tercer número
\el gran total
For ordinal numbers (números ordinales), this is correct, the same order as in English: the first number, el primer número; etc.
But... they have number and gender:
first -> el primer (+ single masculine noun), el primero (used as noun), los primeros (+plural masc. noun), la primera (+ s.f.n.), las primeras (+ p.f.n.)!

We could spot the different cases as they appear in the process of making a bilingual Compiler.

\el color rojo
\el color azul
\el color verde
For the rest of the adjectives, the usual form for everyone is to put it after: the red color, el color rojo, never el rojo color (this sounds so unnatural but poetry!);
colorized flag  ->  bandera coloreada
definite article  -> artículo definido
May be we need a compromise for simplicity: could we permit the odd case of adj+noun in Spanish, but add the case of noun+adj. for a bilingual Plain English/Spanish?
What do you think? Could this ruin the current interpretation of English statements of the Noodle and Compiler?

\These are the rules I found on the internet: http://www.softschools.com/spanish/word_order_for_adjectives_in_spanish/
\Are they correct (ie, actually used in colloquial Spanish)?
They are all correct, but colloquial Spanish could go on only with one case (noun+adj., 1-2-3 uses in that page) except for ordinals, not explained in that page in
the "Adjectives that come before the noun", all exceptional cases to consider in a future may be as particular exceptions.
\More importantly, do we need to handle both forms in the compiler?
No, poetry and emphasized forms are not needed for programming, only adj. then noun; as I say before only for ordinals just like in English, noun then adj.

\2. The English word "string" translates to "cuerda" which translates back to English "rope"!
\What should we call "strings" of text?
We say "una cadena de texto" (a text string), or for short "una cadena" (a string), "la cadena" (the string).
Plural form "(unas) cadenas" (strings), "las cadenas" (the strings).
All these uses are for technical people.
Note: string for other uses indeed is "cuerda" as in a guitar. But no one says "cuerda de texto".

\3. Should we call the language "Español llano" or "Castillian llano" or something else?
Short answer: "Español llano".
Long answer:
If I have to choose, I proposed the international name: "Español". For "Plain", years ago we talk about "simple", and now you came with a synonym "llano".
"Español llano" is a good name but you could not find any reference yet on internet, becuase no one use that sentence or combination. That's both a good and a bad point I guess.
When we say colloquially to talk clearer, the usual way is to say "Hablá en cristiano", literally "Talk in Christian (language)". But that is not as good as "Español llano" for our intentions.
Talking about emphazising adjectives, here in Argentina may be we will call it "Programación en (simple) castellano" if I give a course on it.

\4. Dan has made good progress on the "reverse-possessives" problem.
\Does "Coloque el lado izquierdo del cuadro de la página en el número." sound natural?
Yes, it sounds natural enough if "el número" was previously presented or defined as "un número" as you do in Plain English right now.

\I think it will be a problem that "de la" changes to "del" sometimes.
I remember that you do not distinguish between "A/An" despite it is correct or no to say it so:
A counter is an number.  \this is from the noodle. I know that is not a correct sentence in common English, but compiler does not bother.
May be we could apply the same to "del/de la" masc. and fem. cases respectively.

\5. Google translates differently when I translate a phrase rather than a whole sentence,
\or even just omit the period at the end of a sentence!

\Put the left of the box  ->  Poner la izquierda de la caja
\Put the left of the box of the page into the number  ->  Poner la izquierda del cuadro de la página en el número (sometimes)
\Put the left of the box of the page into the number  ->  Coloca el lado izquierdo del cuadro de la página en el número (sometimes)
\Put the left of the box of the page into the number.  ->  Coloque la izquierda del cuadro de la página en el número.

Well, for "box", I prefer "cuadro".
As in English you could say the left side(/part?) of something, or simply the left of something:
el lado izquierdo de algo / la parte izquierda de algo
versus
la izquierda de algo

Once again, we could choose both natural enough and simplest form, i.e. one to one translation after English reverse possessive is solved:
Put                        the      left                of the       box             of the      page             into        the          number.
Poner/Colocar    la        izquierda      del             cuadro       de  la       página          en            el            número.

We could extend this to ignoring both number and gender in Spanish, gaining simplicity.
un/una: undef. articles
el/la/los/las: def. articles 
de/ del / de la / de los / de las: prep. "de" (+ def. article) = possessive in most cases.

I will review your description and add some suggestions *:
(1) Five kinds of sentences:

*(a) type definitions, which always start with an indefinite article like A, AN, ANOTHER or SOME (UN, UNA, OTRO/OTRA, ALGÚN/ALGUNA);
(b) global variable definitions, which always start with a definite article like THE (EL, LOS, LA, LAS o LO);
*(c) routine headers, which always start with an appropriate preposition like TO (PARA, but not A);
(d) conditional statements, which always start with IF (SI o CUANDO); and
(e) imperative statements, which start with anything else.

(2) Names, which are anything after an article (indefinite or definite) up to:

*(a) any simple verb, like IS, ARE, CAN, or DO (es, son, puede, hacer), or
(b) any conjunction, like AND or OR (y, o), or
*(c) any preposition, like FROM, TO, WITH, or BY (DE/DESDE, A, CON o POR), or
(d) any literal, like 123 or "Hello, World!" (123 o "¡Hola, Mundo!"), or
(e) any punctuation mark.

(3) Reserved words:

(a) infix operators: PLUS, MINUS, TIMES, DIVIDED BY and THEN (which we can worry about later);
(b) special definition words: CALLED and EQUAL (LLAMADO y IGUAL); and
(c) special imperatives: LOOP, BREAK, EXIT, REPEAT and SAY (LAZO, INTERRUMPIR, SALIDA, REPETIR y DECIR).

\That is frightening. Help! \Gerry
Now you have the option to say no to the project. I will understand! :-)
If you want to go on I could do some more, I'm your man.

Pablo
