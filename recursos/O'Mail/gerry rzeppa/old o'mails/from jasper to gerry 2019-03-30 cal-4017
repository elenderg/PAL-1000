Gerry,

I have released the CAL-4017 on both GitHub,
and on the "O:\" drive.

"O:\cal-4017\" is set up so that the program
can be compiled using either CAL-4017 or CAL-4700.
It has a single directory with the source code,
and the call "to test (the compiler - parse ain't)"
is commented out.

CAL-4017 can compute the visual difference
between two colors using the dE-2000 formula.
On my computer, "To measure a delta ratio between a color
and another color" takes about 30 milliseconds.
"To pick a result color near a starting color" takes
65 - 300 milliseconds, with an average of 110 milliseconds.
I wrote a new turtle demo that showed that the color difference
could be as large as 13-1/2, and still have the colors
look similar.  (CAL-4017 does not include the turtle demos.)

In order to perform the color comparisons in a tolerable
amount of time, I added precision timers,
64-bit integers (bigints), and binary logarithms.
I also added a lot of slow tests for the color code.
The test suite now takes 700 milliseconds
instead of its former 130 milliseconds.

If the computer supports it, timers now default to using
precision timers; their strings now show results in milliseconds.
"21" means 21 ms.  Timers now also have microsecond strings.
"21098 µs" means what it says.
Client code can optionally "make a timer be imprecise".

I wrote very little machine code for the new features.
Basically just a routine that performs add-with-carry,
called "to add a number to another number and carry a flag".
I hope that the bigint math can be sped up by using machine
code, but I don't know how to get the correct bits
into and out of the correct registers.
Any tips you can provide would be much appreciated.

I also included Mike Gonta's patch for bumping a rider.
With luck, that should soothe Windows Defender.
