My responses are prefaced with a hyphen.

REGARDING THE ALTERNET:

• What prevents the guy next door from going through (or putting a bomb in) my real-life mailbox?

- Someone trouble-maker in China can't access your physical mailbox. Your real neighbors could go through
   your mail, but at the risk of commiting a felony. You have no way to know who is looking at your Cal mail. 

• Is it possible to make some directories (like the CAL-4700 one) read-only and/or password protected?

- Directories can be made read-only, or only accessible to certain users. When you mapped the z drive, you used the osmosian/osmosian username/password combination.
  Multiple users can be set up, but that has to happen on the server.

REGARDING HOW WELL THIS WORKS:

• How does this work multi-user-wise? I'm typing this response directly in your inbox; what happens if you try to access your inbox while I'm typing?

- Everything is just directories and files on the disk. I can open my folder anytime. As far as an email your typing, if you've saved the file, I will be able to open it 
   and read as much as you have saved. The Cal doesn't lock the files when they are open so I could, theoretically, overwrite your email as you were typing it.

  I typed this reply in my own directory and then cut/pasted it into your directory when I was done, so you wouldn't see a half-finsished response.

REGARDING THE SUDOKU THING:

I'm not sure what you mean by "should the nil check happen before you possibly put 0 into the cell's number?"

- The line that check's for a nil cell should be swapped with the line above it.

Did you notice that the 4700 series lets you run any exe from inside the CAL? Just select the exe and CTRL-R.

- No I did not, but I've since tried it. That's cool.

FROM SHARON:

Sharon wants to know if you think sending email like this is AWESOME or not.

- It's awesome that you can communicate in the Cal.
- Not sure how I feel about messages not being "linked" together. This is more old-school, like sending snail-mail.
- As you mentioned, it would be nice if the plain text editor wrapped. Which is interesting, since it sounds like even you,
  wanted to create a flowing stream of text not tied to physical pages.

Talk to you soon
