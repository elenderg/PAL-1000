\Querido Gerry:

\I agree that the best way to do CAL bilingual is to use a one to one approach for most of the words.

\In that case, we need to use always the infinitive verbs for both the imperative statements and the routine headers,
\as you are doing right now with the bilingual CAL that you are building now.
\Thanks to that there is no need to grow the vocabulary and to distinguish between conjugated verbs and imperative ones.

\To  -> Para
\Do -> Hacer

\Do ...  -> Hacer

\Right now there are some words that you are using that I suggest to change:

Para correr: \I choose "Para ejecutar" hard-coded, is more generic
Puesta en marcha. \ Poner en marcha.
Hacer cosas increíbles. 
Apagar.

Para hacer cosas increíbles:
Borrar la pantalla.
Espera la clave de escape. \ Esperar la tecla de escape.

\ Mixing
La clave de escape is a key equal to 27. \ La tecla de ...

Para espera una clave; \ Para esperar una tecla.

\ About "The Noodle". I know that your approach is to use colloquial English and in some cases funny words, but "los fideos" are a daily dish here
\ and we don't get it "fideos" as the main or principal thing in something. I'm not against the use of "fideos", is a somewhat arbitrary name in Spanish, 
\ but may be in a near future we could find a better expresion to give the idea of "noodle" of something in a funny or clearer way.

\ For the possesives as you say it is difficult because it is needed to recognize the pattern
\ "noun" "de/del/de la" "second noun" as "second noun's noun".

\Tu amigo Pablo
