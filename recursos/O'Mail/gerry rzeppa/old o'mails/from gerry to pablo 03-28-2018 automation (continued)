Yo, Papa!

All those ladder diagrams got me thinking about automation and control systems.

While browsing the web I came across a new product...

https://www.pc-control.co.uk/control/products/images/Automator-UserGuide.pdf

...that can be programmed in an English "Just-Text" language.

It would be trivial, I thought, to write a little program to convert Spanish Just-Text to English Just-Text,
and then people could write automation and control programs in Spanish. And try them out, immediately.
