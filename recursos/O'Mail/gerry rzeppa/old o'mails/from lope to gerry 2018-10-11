       "   Translating to a CAL-version is making me more interested in programming languages in general. I thank you for that. I also see more clearly the contrast between other programming languages and plain english. "

       "  There's a book by David Platt which brings to the forefront the frustrations of computer users. UIs seems to be developed neglecting the very people who use them (he targeted the MS-Windows idiosyncrasies). The same thing has happened with IDEs and programming languages."
       ""
       "   In the case of programming languages, the users are more technically proficient (programmers); yet, all types of improvement with ease of use will benefit every user. Hardware and software got faster, but--after all these years--programs are still written the same way. Code are hard to read and get understood. With the introduction of plain english, a radical way of programming has been ushered in. "

       "   There were attempts in the past to ease up the programming experience. BASIC was a great language and the one I started  with."

       "  I have done the sample program that does the dabbing on the screen and then exited by pressing ""Q"". I've also compiled those programs you sent me last olomail. Some of those (like the colorful wheel one, I've seen before. You talked about them on your old newsgroup/blog posts and it's great that I was able to type them and, then, run the compiled executables. "

       "  By the way, it's admirable how you stouchly defended your Osmosian philosophy on those posts against relentless naysayers (other programmers). They just can't think outside the box for a second."

       "  Thank you for answering the questions I had last time with regards to the console ""stdout"" program (old fashioned DOS interface).  Even though you think it's ugly, it has some uses. It can interface with other programs. Piping has been the UNIX way to get output from these console programs and also to provide parameters to these same. That could work already except that this ""console"" program (short example you provided) opened up its own window--as opposed to using the same window. "

       "  There are some questions I have on my journey through the Instructions book. Can you please give me another explanation if you've gone through this in there; about ""slap"", as in slap a substring to a string. Does that mean append or put value in place of what's there? This might be more than what I think."
