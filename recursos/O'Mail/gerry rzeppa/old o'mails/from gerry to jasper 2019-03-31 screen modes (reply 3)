David has an interesting perspective.
I wonder if he thinks this "big web-programming language"
is a very flexible language (JavaScript) with really gnarly
presentation commands.

\ I think he probably does.

If I ever do become a web programmer
(or tester), I'll need to adopt some of his perspective.

\ If I were ever unfortunate enough to have to write web applications,
\ I would use JavaScript as much as possible, with just the tinest bit of
\ HTML "wrapper" around it. Thank God I don't have to do that.

I still remember the original dream of HTML:
a non-Turing-complete language that would make it easy
to embed images and links in nearly plain-text documents,
while letting the browser automatically render things
in a way that satisfied the users' various preferences.
That ubiquitous style tag subverts the purpose of styles,
and onload events are contrary to everything that
HTML stands for (literally).

\ Yeah, they really screwed that up, didn't they. They somehow managed
\ to go too far and not far enough at the same time.

But that structured approach might put Jorge in the trap
that I'm in...

Under the covers, I can see that the finder, docster,
and writer are pieces of the same program.  But the editor,
compiler, and turtle feel like separate programs to me,
even if they use shared library components
(like the desktop, the math, the string handling, and the text).

\ I agree that the turtle is different from the Finder, Docster, and Writer;
\ after all, the turtle is not accessed directly from the interface at all.
\ As for the rest, the CAL is really just a file manager/viewer/editor/converter.
\ See the chart in your o'mail box for a summary of what the CAL is.
