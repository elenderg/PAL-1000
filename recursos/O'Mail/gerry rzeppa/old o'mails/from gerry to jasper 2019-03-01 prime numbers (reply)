\ Jasper,

My code now takes between 5 and 6 seconds to count the primes
through 250,000.  That is starting without any cached primes,
and performing the full sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

\ That's pretty fast, starting without cached primes.

Your code is much simpler than mine.  But even at 320 lines
(including tests, white space, and bit array code),
mine is shorter.  (When measured in bytes, of course.)

\ Always a trade-off, isn't it. Simplicity/Space/Speed.
