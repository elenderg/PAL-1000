to close a serial port:
    call "kernel32.dll" "CloseHandle" with the serial port.

to open a serial port given a com port string and a baud rate number:
  clear the i/o error.
  privatize the com port.
  null terminate the com port.
  \ open the com port
  call "kernel32.dll" "CreateFileA" with the com port string's first and -1073741824 [generic_read+generic_write] and 0 and 0 and 3 [open_existing] 
    and 0 and 0 returning the serial port.
  if the serial port is -1 [invalid_handle_value], put "Error opening serial port '" then the com port then "'." into the i/o error; exit.
  \ get the current settings so everything gets defaulted correctly
  call "kernel32.dll" "GetCommState" with the serial port and a dcb's whereabouts returning a result number.
  if the result number is 0, put "Error getting comm state" into the i/o error; exit.
  \ set the settings
  put the baud rate into the dcb's baudrate.
  call "kernel32.dll" "SetCommState" with the serial port and the dcb's whereabouts returning the result number.
  if the result number is 0, put "Error setting comm state" into the i/o error; exit.
  \ set the timeouts
  put -1 into a comtimeouts' readintervaltimeout.
  put 0 into the comtimeouts' readtotaltimeoutconstant.
  put 0 into the comtimeouts' readtotaltimeoutmultiplier.
  call "kernel32.dll" "SetCommTimeouts" with the serial port and the comtimeouts' whereabouts returning the result number.
  if the result number is 0, put "Error setting comm timeouts" into the i/o error; exit.

to receive from a serial port into a buffer:
  clear the buffer.
  put 1024 into a size.
  loop.
  clear the i/o error.
  reassign a temp buffer's first given the size.
  put the temp buffer's first plus the size minus 1 into the temp buffer's last.
  call "kernel32.dll" "ReadFile" with the serial port and the temp buffer's first and the size and a number's whereabouts and 0 returning a result number.
  if the result number is 0, put "Error reading from serial port." into the i/o error; exit.
  if the number is 0, exit.
  reassign the temp buffer's first given the number.
  put the temp buffer's first plus the number minus 1 into the temp buffer's last.
  append the temp buffer to the buffer.
  repeat.

a serial port is a handle.

to transmit a buffer to a serial port:
  clear the i/o error.
  call "kernel32.dll" "WriteFile" with the serial port and the buffer's first and the buffer's length and a number's whereabouts and 0 returning a result number.
  if the result number is 0, put "Error writing to serial port." into the i/o error; exit.
