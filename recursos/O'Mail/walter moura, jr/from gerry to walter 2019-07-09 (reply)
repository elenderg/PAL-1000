\ Hello Walter!

I'm thinking of calling "Português Livre", or maybe "Porto livre", meaning in English "Free Portuguese" or "Free Port".
Free in the sense of being free of the strange speech existing in the programming languages in general.

\ If the name needs explaining, it's not an ideal name. "Plain English" is a common term in spoken English which means,
\ "Normal/Ordinary/Standard/Basic English that anyone can understand." This is what Google Translate does with those terms:

\ Português Normal
\ Português ordinário
\ Português padrão
\ Português Básico

\ Perhaps one of those names would be good.

To facilitate the conversion operation I have created a version of the compiler that receives the directory to be compiled by the command line.
So I created a little routine in my Noodles to get the command line arguments. The following is the case if you want to use the codes in the CAL's Nodles:

[code removed]

\ You are apparently not working exclusively in the CAL or SAL to you create your PAL. I must say that I am disappointed
\ that you think it necessary to drag Linux-style tools and conventions (like the command line) into your system.
\ It is the lack of a command line (and the lack of scroll bars, dialog boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, etc) which, along with
\ alphabetical menus and full-screen tabbed workspaces (instead of overlapping, resizezble windows) that give the CAL its
\ distinctive look and feel (proving, by example, that such things are not necessary for convenient and efficient programming).

\ Jasper Paulson has defaced and diluted our system in similar ways with his version of Plain English. See here...

https://github.com/Folds/osmosian/issues

\ ...for his project (and some of my comments about it). Jasper has an o'mail box that you can use to contact him, if you wish.
\ In any case, if you find yourself leaning more toward Jasper's way of thinking than mine, I will give you the same advice I gave him:

\ Stop compromising the Osmosian Image and develop a command-line, interface-free version of Plain English specifically designed
\ to attract Linux aficionados. You can start with the Plain English EBNF description of the language (it's in the "documentation" directory)
\ and use whatever conventional tools (like LEX and YACC), techniques (a separate editor and compiler), and programming language (C, C++)
\ you like to develop it.

\ There is no problem with me if you want to export some good ideas from "Plain English Land" to the outside world; but please
\ do not drag the world's rubbish into the pristine landscape of "Plain English Land."

Big hug.

\ A big hug to you, too.

\ Gerry
