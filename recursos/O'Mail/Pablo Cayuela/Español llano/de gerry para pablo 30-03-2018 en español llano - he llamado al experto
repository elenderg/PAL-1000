Hola, Pablo.

I have called in the expert (my son Dan) to help with the posssesive problem. He's working on it now.

I have made the changes you suggested to the "vocabulary" (clava -> tecla, etc).

I have also change the name of the noodle to "el biblioteca". We could use "el archivo" if you like that better.
"Noodle" was based on an English idiom where the brain of a person is called their "noodle" because brains
look a little like spaghetti.

Keep in mind that there are two parts to the compiler:

1. Hard code in the compiler itself (articles, conjunctions, prepositions, a few simple verbs, etc).
2. Soft code in the noodle and in the programmer's source files.

The idea is to put as little as possible into the compiler. The name of the noodle file, for example,
can be anything the programmer wants it to be (as long as it doesn't have an extension, like ".txt", on the end)
since the CAL will compile any file that doesn't have an extension.

So except for the articles, conjunctions, prepositions, simple verbs, and keywords (like EJECUTAR y LAZO y REPETIR),
the rest will be up to you (and any programmers who write "programas en llano español"), since you're the ones
who know what "sounds natural" in Spanish.

By the way, why does Plain Spanish sometimes translate sometimes as "llano español" and sometimes as "español llano"?
I hope this will not be a problem. The CAL expects adjectives to come before nouns because the ending word(s) of a name
are supposed to be the type name (if the whole name is not a dictinct type).
For example, "a number" and "an odd number" and "a very odd number" are all assumed to be variables of type "number".
Let me know.

Hasta ahora, muy bien, mi amigo. Que Dios prospere el trabajo de nuestras manos.

Gerry
