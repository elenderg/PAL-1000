Thanks, Pablo.

You are helping very much and saving me a LOT of tedious work.

I've got the colors and the keys in the SAL-1004 now. When we get those ASCII "byte" variables in there,
(and I do a little more testing) I will post a copy of the SAL-1004 and will start working on the SAL-1005.

I was able to get the "full spanish" versions of the keys to work...

\all Spanish version: \La tecla-a es una tecla igual a 65.

...including the "a". But only because "EQUAL TO" is a special case; "a" as a preposition, in general, is still a problem.

Now to answer your questions:

\The Ñ/ñ is working in CAL and SAL, how is this possible? I can't find the code in the Noodle.

I don't know what you mean by "working". Versions prior to the SAL-1004 should see "ñ" as not equal to "Ñ".
And the incremental find (CTRL-B) should get interrupted if you press the ALT key to type ALT-0241, for example.
But it's better (I think) in the SAL-1004.

\Name is "eñe" in Spanish, but could be n-tilde or n-virgulilla for the hybrid SAL.

Whichever one you like. After all, you know what sounds "natural" in Spanish; I have no idea.

\By the way, in CAL/SAL I never could use the keys that have a third symbol, such as backslash \, left/right brackets [ ],
\l/r braces { }, pipe |, at @, hash #, tilde ~, euro €‚¬, not-sign ¬, because all of this both in Spanish and Latin American keyboards
\works in combination and after releasing the key ALT GRAPHIC (in place of the right ALT). Please, check an image of that keyboards.
\When I need one of that symbols in CAL/SAL, I always copied from previous written texts.

That is a problem. We will have to fix that. Somehow. Is this what your keyboard looks like?
