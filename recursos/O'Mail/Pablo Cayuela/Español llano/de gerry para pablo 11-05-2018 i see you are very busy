Dear Papa Pablo,

I see you are very busy. Perhaps I can help.

Look for the "instrucciones 3000 v1" in your mailbox.
I have adjusted the margins and the drawings on all the pages.
I have also translated (with the help of Google) the pages that you have not yet translated.
I suspect the translations are not very good.

The pages in the Glossary will have to be sorted when the topic names are final.
And the index will have to be sorted, as well. But I can take care of those things.

What I cannot do, without your help, is choose the right words for the types and
routine headers in the Glossary (and thus El Selo and/or El Compilador).
I don't want to change El Seso or El Compilador until we are sure about these words.

So...

The UPPERCASE words in the Glossary need to be checked and finalized by you.
Just edit a page, when you have time, and let me know the page number.
I will make the corresponding changes to El Seso and/or El Compilador 3000.
Page 96 is an easy one.

Little by little we will finish this project, God willing.

Tu amigo,

Gerry
