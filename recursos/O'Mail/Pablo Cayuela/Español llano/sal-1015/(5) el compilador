If the fragment's routine is nil, abort with "Internal error - transmogrify a fragment (routine address)"; exit.
Get an address given the fragment's routine.
Attach $C702 and the address to the fragment's code. \ mov [edx],the address

To transmogrify a fragment (save eax):
Attach address loading code to the fragment's code given the fragment's variable. \ put address into edx
If the fragment's variable is nil, abort with "Internal error - transmogrify a fragment (save eax)"; exit.
If the fragment's variable's type is nil, abort with "Internal error 2 - transmogrify a fragment (save eax)"; exit.
Put the fragment's variable's type's length into a length.
If the length is 4, attach $8902 to the fragment's code; exit. \ mov [edx],eax
If the length is 2, attach $668902 to the fragment's code; exit. \ mov [edx],ax
If the length is 1, attach $8802 to the fragment's code; exit. \ mov [edx],al
Abort with "Internal error 3 - transmogrify a fragment (save eax)".

To transmogrify some fragments:
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Get a fragment from the fragments.
If the fragment is nil, exit.
Transmogrify the fragment.
Repeat.

To transmogrify a routine:
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the routine is nil, exit.
If the routine's employs moniker is not blank, exit.
If the routine's compiled flag is not set, exit.
Put the routine into the current routine.
Transmogrify the routine's fragments.

To transmogrify some routines:
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Get a routine from the routines.
If the routine is nil, break.
Transmogrify the routine.
Repeat.

The transmogrifying timer is a timer.

The type index is an index.

A type is a thing with
A locus (reference),
A name, a plural name,
A partial moniker,
A length,
A base name, a base type (reference),
A target name, a target type (reference) [pointers only],
A scale ratio,
Some fields [records only],
A cooking flag,
A optional info resolved flag.

A type name is a name.

The types are some types.

The utility index is an index.

A variable is a thing with
A locus (reference),
A kind [literal, global, local, parameter, scratch],
A compiled flag,
A name, a nickname, a type name,
A type (reference), \ actual type on literal, global, local; dereferenced type on parameters and scratches
An address [globals and literals only] or 
An offset at the address [locals, parameters, and fields only],
A count [fields only],
A reference flag [fields only],
A redefinition target name [fields only],
A by-value flag [parameters only],
An global body [globals only],
An initializer string [globals only],
A literal (reference) [globals only - constant with which to initalize the global],
A hex string called data [literals only].

The writing timer is a timer.

To skip any trailing noise in a substring:
If the substring is blank, exit.
If the substring's last's target is not noise, exit.
Subtract 1 from the substring's last.
Repeat.

\ dahn - reverse functions
\ to put the xxx uv a/the yyy into zzz
\ internally we turn this into "to put a/the yyy's xxx into zzz"
To compile the header of a routine given a rider (reverse-possessive function):
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Set the routine's function flag.
Add a monikette to the routine's monikettes given "put".
Move the rider (compiler rules). \ skip "put" or "poner"
Move the rider (compiler rules). \ skip "the" or Spanish definite article
Scan a name given the rider. \ field name
Move the rider (compiler rules). \ skip "uv" or "de"
If the rider's token is any indefinite article, set a flag.
If the flag is set, compile the routine's monikettes and the routine's parameters given the rider (indefinite article).
If the flag is not set, compile the routine's monikettes and the routine's parameters given the rider (definite article).
Add another monikette to the routine's monikettes given "'s " then the name.
If the rider's token is not any reverse-possessive function into, abort with "Esperaba la palabra 'en', pero encontré '" then the rider's token then "'." and the rider; exit.
Add a third monikette to the routine's monikettes given "into".
Convert the routine's monikettes to a moniker.
If the moniker is in the routine index, abort with "Ya sé cómo '" then the moniker then "'." and the routine's locus; exit.
Index the routine given the routine's monikettes and the routine index.
Move the rider (compiler rules).
If the rider's token is not any indefinite article, abort with "Esperaba un artículo indefinido, pero encontré '" then the rider's token then "'." and the rider; exit.
Compile the routine's monikettes and the routine's parameters given the rider (indefinite article).
If the rider's token is not blank, abort with "Hay cosas demás en el final de esta función." and the rider; exit.
Convert the routine's monikettes to the routine's moniker.
Index the routine given the routine's monikettes and the routine index. \ for employs

\ dahn - reverse functions
\ to put the xxx uv a/the yyy into zzz
To decide if a rider is the start of any reverse-possessive function:
If the compiler's abort flag is set, say no.
If the rider's token is not any put, say no.
Privatize the rider.
Move the rider (compiler rules).
If the rider's token is not any definite article, say no.
Move the rider (compiler rules).
Scan a name given the rider.
If the rider is not on any reverse-possessive, say no.
Say yes.
