Good Gerry!

Here it goes!

--------------------------
\Looking good, Pablo!

\The SAL-1003 has so much Spanish in it I can no longer read the menus or the messages!
\I've kept some of the shortcut keys the same so I don't need the menus for most tasks.

\The shortcut keys are summarized in a chart in your mailbox.

\We have three tedious tasks ahead of us:

\1. Names for all the bytes in the ASCII chart, page 58 of the manual. In the Noodle they look like this:
Hope you could deduce from these examples.

The at-sign byte is a byte equal to 64. \ arroba, and not símbolo-arroba nor signo-arroba, do you like it that?
The backslash byte is a byte equal to 92. \ barra invertida
The big-a byte is a byte equal to 65. \ "A mayúscula" the big one. "a minúscula" the little one. All the letters the same.
The big-a-acute byte is a byte equal to 193. \ A mayúscula acentuada (prefered), A mayúscula con acento agudo (only to distinguish from the other ones), A may. aguda
The big-a-circumflex byte is a byte equal to 194. \  A mayúscula con acento circunflejo, not Spanish, but Portuguese, French, others. For short: A may. circunfleja
The big-a-diaeresis byte is a byte equal to 196. \ A mayúscula con diéresis. For short: A may. diéresis
The big-a-grave byte is a byte equal to 192. \ A mayúscula con acento grave, not Spanish, but Catalan, Italian, French. For short: A may. grave
The big-a-ring byte is a byte equal to 197. \ Angstrom, unit of lenght; as a letter not Spanish, but Nordic langs. Alt: A may. con anillo
The big-a-tilde byte is a byte equal to 195. \ A may. con virgulilla, not Spanish, but Portuguese. For short: A may. virgulilla
The big-ae byte is a byte equal to 198. \ ligadura AE mayúscula, not Spanish, but Medieval Latin, French and old British English, Nordics. For short: AE may.
The big-b byte is a byte equal to 66. \ B mayúscula
The big-c byte is a byte equal to 67. \ C mayúscula
The big-c-cedilla byte is a byte equal to 199. \ Cedilla mayúscula, old Spanish, current Catalan Portuguese and French

\Google does not translate them consistently. I can give you the whole list, if you think that best, or
\perhaps you can give me a rule (and some examples) to follow so I can translate them myself.
\Nouns and adjectives only, no "de la"s if possible.

\2. Names for all the keys on the keyboard. In the Noodle they look like this:

The a-key is a key equal to 65. \ tecla a
The accent key is a key equal to 192. \ tecla acento
The alt key is a key equal to 18. \ tecla alt
The b-key is a key equal to 66. \ tecla b
The backspace key is a key equal to 8. \ tecla retroceso

\Again, Google does not translate these consistently. And again, I can give you the whole list, or
\you can give me a rule and some examples and I'll do the grunt work.

3. Names for all the colors in our standard palette, page 63 of the manual. In the Noodle they look like this:

The lightest red color is a color.  \ color rojo clarísimo
The lighter red color is a color. \ color rojo claro
The light red color is a color. \ color rojo suave
The red color is a color. \ color rojo
The dark red color is a color. \ color rojo opaco
The darker red color is a color. \ color rojo oscuro
The darkest red color is a color. \ color rojo oscurísimo


\There is a lightest, lighter, light, [normal], dark, darker, darkest group for each of 13 basic hues:

Names for:
\gray, red, orange, yellow, lime, green, teal, cyan, sky, blue, purple, magenta, violet
gris, rojo, naranja, amarillo, lima, verde, menta, cian, celeste, azul, púrpura, magenta, fucsia

Rule for
\lightest, lighter, light, [normal], dark, darker, darkest
clarísimo, claro, suave, [normal/puro], opaco, oscuro, oscurísimo

\The "*" menu at the far right of the menu bar has all the colors on it, in order.

\Google makes it look like Spanish doesn't have anything like "light, lighter, lightest", so again, 
\I can give you the whole list or you can give me a rule and some examples (along with names for
\the 13 basic hues). Give me names for "brown" and "tan/beige" too, since these colors are actually
\just dark and light shades of "orange".

Brown - marrón
tan/beige - beige


When we get these three things done, the tedious, boring work will be at an end (I think).
Then we can get back to translating the manual, including the "Sal Monet" sample program and
the Gray Matter Glossary.

So far, so good, I would say. Still looks feasible. And still compiles itself in less than 5 seconds.

Dan helped me fix our machine-code uppercase, lowercase, and string comparison routines so they now work with accented characters.
And the "incremental find" (CTRL-B, start typing) now finds accented characters when you type them without accents.
For example, CTRL-B followed by typing "e s p a n o l" will find "Español", in both the Editor and the Writer.

The compiler, however, still thinks accented characters are different from their un-accented counterparts (eg, "n" is not equal to "ñ").
But we can change that easily now that we use "translation tables" in the comparison routines.

I hope all is well with you and yours.

Gerry
