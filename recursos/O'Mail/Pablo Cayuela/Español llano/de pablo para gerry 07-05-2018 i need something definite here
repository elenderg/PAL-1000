Dear Gerry,

\Dear Papa Pablo,
\\The rule that you guess I find it correct for our purposes, that "a" followed by definite article could be treated as an English preposition:
\\a + la + fem. noun
\\a + el + masc. noun -> al + masc. noun
\\Contraction "al" from "a+el", similar to "del=de+el".
\\Old Spanish use "a el" but we read it as well as "al".
\\I didn't evaluate if "a" followed by indefinite article would be treated as an English preposition:
\\a + una + fem. noun
\\a + un + masc. noun
\I will see what I can do with "a" tonight, and send you updated 1012 files.
Ok.

\It's the contractions that are the problem. But that's not surprising, since even Data,
\the advanced Android on "Star Trek the Next Generation," had trouble with contractions.

haha!

\\I like all of them:
\\caja: common word
\\cuadro: more technical
\\rectángulo: pretty common and technical word

\That's great, and the SAL can support all of them as synonyms.
\But note: We use "rect" as short for  "rectangle" in the Writer, and it is something different than a simple box.
Ok, reserve "el rectángulo" for that if you need.

\*** ATENCIÓN / IMPORTANTE: ***

\I need to know which word you want as the primary word for box; the word that will appear in the
\Sal Monet (18 times) and the full Instruction Manual (about 145 times) and El Seso (many  more times).
\There are only 59 total occurrences now, but there will be too many to conveniently change later.
\It's not easy changing them because the articles (including contractions) have to change as well.

A box for us is a cardboard box (una caja). That's why Google gives you "caja". A usual word for anybody.
Not usual a "caja" on screen, but a common word.
Go with "caja".

una caja: a box
la caja: the box
las cajas: the boxes
de una caja: uv a box
de la caja: uv the box

\\ Pablo el lenguaraz.

\I'm still having trouble translating that. The linked page is in Spanish and Google doesn't translate it well.
\Is it "a person who has mastered two languages"? or, "a person who dares to speak two languages"?
Yes to both, the modern translation would be an interpreter, is not a usual word now. 
El lenguaraz was a key member of the expedition of conquistadores all over America.
And in Argentina, the recent conquista del desierto (end of XIX century) against south indians was even made it with the help of many lenguaraces.
An alternative connotation is a shameless chatterer. 

\In either case, we should call the bilingual SAL, "Sal Lenguaraz" :)
SAL la lenguaraz, great!

\Tu amigo,
\Gerry

Tu amigo Pablo.
