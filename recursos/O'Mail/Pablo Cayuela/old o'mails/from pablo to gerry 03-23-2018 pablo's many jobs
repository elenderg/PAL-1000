Dear Gerry,

I'm an 18-year professor by now in my university (UTN FRC), but this year two private universities call me to teach.
That's good news to me (old saying here "Todo hijo viene con un pan bajo el brazo", and I take it), but it takes some time
to prepare new materials and get accustomed to its paperwork; it also implies a daily moving from place to place.

Nowadays, I've been teaching and giving exams:

My usual work at Cordoba,
- Physics Basics (South Cone) summer course to enter the University. Yearly.
- Computer Architecture summer course for Information Systems Eng. freshmen. Only this year for people that not passed last year course .
- Computer Architecture for Information Systems Eng. freshmen. Second semester.
- Ladder programming, Electrical Machines and Installations for Electronics Eng. juniors. All year long.
- SoC in VHDL for CPLD & FPGA for Electron. Eng. seniors. First semester.
- PC boot process programming and embedded C programming for Electron. Eng. juniors. I travel monthly 500 km 
   away to La Rioja city to teach this. All year long.

New ones at Cordoba,
- Flow Diagrams and C Basics in Programming Fundamentals for freshmen. First semester.
   (I'm tempted to use your plain English as executable "pseudocode" but Students rarely understand English!
   I neither do have that liberty or endorsement from authorities.)
- Electricity Basics on a lab for Robotics Technician freshmen. First semester.
