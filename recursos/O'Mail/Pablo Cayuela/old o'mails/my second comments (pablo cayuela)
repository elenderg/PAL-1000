Dear Gerry,

I found a new strange behavior: yesterday the first time I need to launch CAL with Admin rights in order to view z: drive.
Today I need to launch it without admin rights to see z:.

Another thing: I check a text view of the welcome file, and found that I only can see "Welcome to the..." but not the action of the inside instructions nor any more messages on screen.

Security and access: I found it strange to enter your directory and open everything; I atribbute it to your confidence in me. In that way I could read about the inner workings and sudoku solver.

I suggest to delay some more the animation of the solving process or it could be adjustable to see the steps of the solutions.

Right now I have not an answer to the nil check question. 

About the solution strategy I never think of. By the way, I never solve any sudoku before! My mother was a fan of.
 
Launching sudoku solver from z: drive: sudoku windows open just a moment; then is on my windows panel but can show again nor press enter to solve, because I can't view it maximized again.
I can't close it by clicking the iconic window that resemble the big sudoku. I only could kill the task on task manager. 

Pablo

PS: I found an awful use of O-Mail in the internet, offuscated mail.
PS2: What a fool! I press enter over the "Welcome to the..." and voilà!
