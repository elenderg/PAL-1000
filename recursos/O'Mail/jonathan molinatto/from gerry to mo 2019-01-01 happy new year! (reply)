happy new year!!

\ ditto

that CP/M system looks interesting.

\ CP/M is "living" proof that an OS can be nothing more than a collection of BIOS-like subroutines with
\ a loader that just loads an executable into memory and passes control to the instruction at the first byte.
\ If a 32-bit CP/M existed today, the CAL would not be running on Windows.
\ I wonder why such a thing has never been developed.

i've been looking at freebsd as another operating system i've heard a lot about but never used.
it seems interesting, though it's similar to linux in that it doesn't always have graphical display and mouse support
(it's used in a lot of routers and servers, which run headless).

\ BSD is really just another flavor of UNIX. Way more than the KAL needs.

however, its executable format is the a.out format (which is much simpler than the elf spec).

\ Simpler, yes. But not as simple as the original CP/M spec. I paraphrase from Wikipedia:
\ "The original binary executable format used in CP/M is very simple; it has no header and no metadata,
\ only code and data (in any order, except the program's first instruction must reside at the first byte)."

more and more research...

\ My advice is to stick with the CP/M-style system. Give me a 32-bit CP/M with a keyboard, a mouse, a disk, a gigabyte
\ of memory, and a screen buffer with a fast "draw pixel" subroutine, and I'll put the KAL on it in six weeks or less.
\ And I'll be able to explain the whole shebang, top to bottom, to a bright 12-year-old.

i hope the holiday season has treated you well! 

\ Thanks. We don't actually pay much attention to holidays. In fact, we went to the library today and were
\ surprised they weren't open.
