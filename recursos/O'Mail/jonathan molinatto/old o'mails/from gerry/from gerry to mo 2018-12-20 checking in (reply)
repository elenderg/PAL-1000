do you know of any resources for looking at the code for those things [computers like the Apple II, and
PCs running DOS and the original Macintosh] or should i just reverse-engineer it?

\ Detailed information about those operating systems is suprisingly hard to find. Most articles describe
\ them from the user's point of view which is not helpful to us. I was, however, able to find this ONE PAGE article...

\ http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/cpm/mirrors/www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/5711/architec.html

\ ...which describes the kind of "operating system" I've been picturing for the KAL, minus the interrupts. But if
\ interrupt routines do nothing but temporarily buffer data, I'm not sure there is much difference.

\ A pretty good description of the original Macintosh hardware can be found here:

\ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K/512K_technical_details

well, nothing really to report. just catching up.

\ Same here.
