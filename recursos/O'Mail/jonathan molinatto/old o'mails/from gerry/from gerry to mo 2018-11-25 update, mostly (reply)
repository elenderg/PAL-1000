\ Yo, Mo!

i've been playing around with CAL in windows (obviously), and looking at the ELF header documentation.
there are highs, there are lows; progress is slow, epiphanies are elusive. (i used to be more poetic.)

\ The official definition of Window's PE format is 77 pages long.
\ A document I found  describing the ELF standard is a little better, with only 60 pages.
\ I'm pretty sure I could describe the tiny part of the PE format we actually use in less than five pages.
\ Shoot for something like that.

i think i'm going to keep studying the linux/mac possibilities, but focus on getting to know CAL.
i have successfully written the interface for a simple calculator program (just the buttons on the screen),
but i haven't wired up the actual calculus, yet. it was a lot of fun. you've really got something here!

\ Thanks. I look forward to seeing yoru calculator.

the more i think about what you said about linux, the more i'm convinced that a mac will have
the default libraries and environment installed for every build. i don't know of a single headless mac
(even the tower/trash can and the mac mini have desktop environments).

\ I have no doubt that ALL Macs will have the necessary routines "built in".
\ The 128-kilobyte Mac that I bought in 1985 had them all. Surely they're still there.

i have a mac to play with, so i should be able to get that going. i'm just not as familiar with
the Mach-O object format.

\ The definition I found for the Mach-O format is 92 pages long.
\ But I'm pretty sure the parts we actually need can be described in less than five.
\ I wish I could get these prodigals to spend a week or two with Aunt Tilly.

the eventual goal is to have support for the full CAL in mac and linux,
but i recognize i have set my sights on a great white whale.

\ Call me Ishmael, Cap'n Ahab. "A wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling is in me."

do you work on CAL full time?

\ Not really. But I do love it.

do you have a different day job?

\ Only homeschooling our 13-year-old Chuckles, mostly in woodworking at the moment.
\ I was 53 when he was born, and Sharon, my wife, was 57. We felt so much like the
\ Biblical Abraham and Sarah (having prayed and waited so long for a son), that we
\ named him Chuckles (after Isaac, which is Hebrew for "laughter").
\ Dan (41) and his sister Joanne (39, who manages warehouses for Amazon) are fruits of
\ a previous marriage.

have you retired?

\ It would be hard to tell if I had. We made millions with (www.era-sql.com) in our youth.
\ That part of the journey is summed up in the last article on our Plain English blog, entitled
\ "A Solution to the Fatal Flaw in Relational Database Systems" which you can find here...
\ https://osmosianplainenglishprogramming.blog/
\ ...if you scroll to the bottom three times, then back up just a little. (I'm not good with systems
\ that aren't WYSIWYG). But it's worth the read, if only for the description of CAL's grandpa, PERSPECTIVE.

\ After that I did whatever came my way: electrical engineering, music, architecture, 
\ homeschooling Dan, pastoring a home church, writing, painting, etc.

\ After 29 years, the money ran out, and in 2009 we declared bankruptcy to get a fresh start.
\ Since then we've been living modestly (but well) on Social Security and Sharon's General Motor's retirement,
\ in a duplex with a 100-acre farm out the back door, a Walmart in walking distance out the front,
\ and a babbling brook out the side window. Really couldn't ask for a better location. God is good.

\ My recent work includes a couple of failed Kickstarter projects:
\ https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1335354839/art-for-the-rest-of-us
\ https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1335354839/banana-jack-amps-no-solder-all-tube-guitar-amp-kit
\ And one creation you might even find useful with your kids:
\ http://www.rhymingreader.com/
\ I also made an attempt to revitalize the old "text adventure" paradigm with a project that drove me,
\ in a desperate attempt to devise a system that would run on any machine with a browser, to convert a couple
\ hundred Plain English sentences into JavaScript. I shudder to even mention it now. More on that, if you're interested, here:
\ https://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=10860

i'm hoping to retire at age 58 and spend all my time working on open-source projects (like CAL, for instance),
when my retirement accounts are sufficiently padded.

\ Well, you know what they say: "If you want to hear God laugh, tell Him your plans."
\ Though I must admit I prefer, "Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans."
\ Don't get me wrong; I wish you success. And if the CAL can help get you where you want to be, all the better.

i don't mean to pry, so don't hesitate to tell me to buzz off if i overstep!

\ No problem. Life is too s hort to worry about such things. I had some serious heart problems a
\ couple of years ago and the doctors gave me 24 hours to live. Quacks! I'm back to normal now.

anyway, i'll keep plugging away, but i probably won't keep writing you long missives every day.
relationships with me can become tiresome for most people. i'm self-aware enough to know that much.

\ I look forward to hearing from you. Share all you like.

do CAL aficionados get together ever?

\ There aren't many of us. Dan is busy with his family and his lucrative ugly-programming-language company,
\ and the person who has done the most work on (his own version) of the CAL doesn't get along
\ very well with Aunt Tilly. See here...
\ https://github.com/Folds/osmosian/issues/4
\ ...for a summary of my views on his early work, in spite of which we still communicate from time to time.
\ His name is Jasper Paulsen and he has an O'Mail box in with the others (if you'd like to contact him).
\ See also here...
\ https://github.com/Folds/osmosian/issues/1
\ ...for various ways in which folks are inclined to "miss the point" of our system.

are there any conferences you frequent?
i have a lifelong-learning budget at my job, but i never go to any conferences.
i've found most to be a waste of time. i perhaps haven't found the right ones, yet.

\ I don't watch videos to learn things because they're too slow. Conferences are even slower. And costlier.
\ If somebody has something important to say, they should put it in a PDF, or at least on a blog.

i think my wife is getting tired of hearing about Plain English from me. she's expecting my attention span to shift,
i'm sure. much like it did with java, go, groovy, kotlin, lisp, etc. in fairness, i really like the simplicity and power of lisp,
but i couldn't ever get anyone else on board. it can be cumbersome to carry the enthusiasm all by myself.

\ Lisp is clever, yes, but it's UNNATURAL. Recursion, for example, is an unnatural way of dealing with most iterative processes.
\ Lisp also rivals FORTH in unreadablilty. And I say that with respect; I like Forth.
\ We were trying to make a "readable Forth," called Fifth, in fact, when we came up with Plain English.
\ I'm not surprised that people - especially ordinary people - don't like Lisp and Forth.

do you have a git repo where you put Plain English programs you've written?

\ Nope. The handful of Plain English programs I've written are in directories on my hard drive.
\ When I want to share one with somebody, I just paste it into his O'Mail box.

if not, would you mind if i upload mine to my github account?

\ I don't mind, but don't expect me to find it there. Regarding Github, see:
\ https://github.com/Folds/osmosian/issues/3
\ Just stick your program in my O'Mail box and I'll take a look at it.

i'd like to get your notes on the little calculator when i get it finished.
perhaps you'll spot inefficiencies that will help me get better.

\ I'm looking forward to seeing it.

in a roundabout way, i'm basically saying that you were right that i should just spend more time with CAL
before trying to port it. at least it's a fun project!

\ I'm glad you're enjoying your time with the CAL.

i'm fully aware that i'm coming across like a fanboy. i have no counter-argument.

\ Since you're "coming across like a fanboy" I've put a copy of "The Golden Key" in your mailbox.
\ It's an introduction to programming that I've been working on for Chuckles, in case he ever
\ shows an interest. It's even got an little reverse-polish calculator in it. Unfortunately, it's incomplete.
\ But I think you'll get the idea; start reading the book (the PDF version looks better) and imagine that
\ the Golden Key USB drive (see .jpg photo) has a bootable Linux on it.
\ Copy it to your computer to run the programs; it's faster than running off our server.

\ See you soon. All the best to you and yours,
\ Gerry
