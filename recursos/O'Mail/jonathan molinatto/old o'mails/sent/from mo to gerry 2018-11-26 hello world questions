so i found the actual "hello world" program on the blog. i typed it all up in a directory with the
noodle, but it won't compile. i wanted to try to pull in the pieces i needed, but i was sufficiently
chastised from your last email, so i decided to ask a question instead.

so the noodle doesn't seem to know how to "Start in the center of the screen." i will happily 
search through the other files to figure out what i'm supposed to be doing, but i'd like to try
to keep it Osmosian.

from the blog

To run:
  Start up.
  Clear the screen.
  Use medium letters. Use the fat pen.
  Pick a really dark color.
  Loop.
  Start in the center of the screen.
  Turn left 1/32 of the way.
  Turn right. Move 2 inches. Turn left.
  Write “HELLO WORLD”.
  Refresh the screen.
  Lighten the current color about 20 percent.
  Add 1 to a count. If the count is 32, break.
  Repeat.
  Wait for the escape key.
  Shut down.

peace,
