Thanks, Dan.

I should probably do the integrating. The SAL changes every day.

I probably won't attempt any big changes until Monday - we're taking Chuckles to the Avengers on Sunday
and I don't want to leave anything hanging on Saturday.

I've got the whole Sal Monet (Spanish Cal Monet) working now. There are only a couple of problems
that we can talk about when I'm not too tired. On the whole, it's looking really good.

Call anytime you have questions.

Thanks again,

Dahd
