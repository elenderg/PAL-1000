The internal English form, I think, is fine.

But keep in mind the function has to be callable in the reverse-possessive fashion,
with the Spanish "field" name, for example,

dibujar  el    centro  de   el      cuadro    con      el      color rojo.  
draw      the  center  uv   the    box          with    the    red color.  \ Literal English version; if this works, I can get the Spanish to work (God willing)
draw      the box's center                          with    the    red color.

The FUNCTION headers would look like this:

Para    poner     el    centro  de  un cuadro     en       un   punto;  \ Spanish header that will be in the Spanish noodle
To       put          the center   uv  a   box          into    a    spot;      \ Literal English version (for testing) that will NOT be included in the Spanish noodle
To       put          a box's center                        into    a    spot:      \ Normal English version that will be in the Spanish noodle

And the ROUTINE headers would look like this:

Para    dibujar    un    punto     con      un    color;
To       draw         a     spot        with     a      color:

It's curious, but this already works...

Put el center de la pantalla into a punto. \ Put the screen's center into a spot.

...without your 4701 changes and with no special header on the "put a box's center into a spot" function;
just these definitions:

Un cuadro es a box.
La pantalla tiene un cuadro, a pixel height and a pixel width. \ The screen has a box, a pixel height and a pixel width.
