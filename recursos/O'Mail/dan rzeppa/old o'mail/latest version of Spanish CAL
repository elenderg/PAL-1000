You have to use the 1004 to compile the 1005.
The interface and error messages are all Spanish.
The important shortcut keys are the same, except CTRL-S is find next (as well as CTRL-N) and save is CTRL-G.
If you write a test program you have to say "Para ejecutar:" instead of "To run:". The rest you can write in English or a mix of Spanish and English.

If it's easier, you can just fix the CAL-4700 to handle "ov" in function headers and I can do the translating.
