To decide if a row of a text is selected:
If the text is nil, say no.
If the row is nil, say no.
If nothing is selected in the text, say no.
Put the text's normalized selection into a selection.
If the row's row# is less than the selection's anchor row#, say no.
If the row's row# is greater than the selection's caret row#, say no.
If the row's row# is not the selection's caret row#, say yes.
If the selection's caret column# is 1, say no.
Say yes.
