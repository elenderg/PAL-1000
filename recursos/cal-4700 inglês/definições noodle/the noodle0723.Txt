To decide if a string is any integer:
Slap a substring on the string.
If the substring is blank, say no.
If the substring's first's target is any sign, add 1 to the substring's first.
If the substring is blank, say no.
Loop.
If the substring's first's target is not any digit, say no.
Add 1 to the substring's first.
If the substring is blank, say yes.
Repeat.
