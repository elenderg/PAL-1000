To decide if a substring is on any contraction:
Put the substring's first plus 1 into a byte pointer.
If the byte pointer is greater than the substring's last, say no.
If the substring's first's target is not the single-quote byte, say no.
If the byte pointer's target is not any letter, say no.
Say yes.
