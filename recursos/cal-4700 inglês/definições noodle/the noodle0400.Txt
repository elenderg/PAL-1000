To create the hpen of a canvas given a color:
Convert the color to a colorref.
If the color is clear, put the null hpen into an hpen.
Put the tpp times the pen size into a number.
If the canvas is the printer canvas, put 1/96 inch times the pen size into the number.
If the color is not clear, call "gdi32.dll" "CreatePen" with 0 [ps_solid] and the number and the colorref returning the hpen. 
Call "gdi32.dll" "SelectObject" with the canvas and the hpen.
