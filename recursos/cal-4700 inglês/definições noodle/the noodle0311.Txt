To compatibly handle any message with a window a message number a w-param and an l-param:
If the message is 006, handle any wm-activate with the w-param; put 0 into eax; exit.
If the message is 258, handle any wm-char with the w-param and the l-param; put 0 into eax; exit.
If the message is 001, handle any wm-create with the window; put 0 into eax; exit.
If the message is 002, handle any wm-destroy; put 0 into eax; exit.
If the message is 256, handle any wm-keydown with the w-param and the l-param; put 0 into eax; exit.
If the message is 513, handle any wm-lbuttondown with the l-param; put 0 into eax; exit.
If the message is 515, handle any wm-lbuttondblclk with the l-param; put 0 into eax; exit.
If the message is 015, handle any wm-paint with the window; put 0 into eax; exit.
If the message is 516, handle any wm-rbuttondown with the l-param; put 0 into eax; exit.
If the message is 518, handle any wm-rbuttondblclk with the l-param; put 0 into eax; exit.
If the message is 032, handle any wm-setcursor; put 1 into eax; exit.
If the message is 260, handle any wm-syskeydown with the w-param and the l-param; put 0 into eax; exit.
Call "user32.dll" "DefWindowProcA" with the window and the message and the w-param and the l-param.
