To convert a gpbitmap to a buffer (pdf style):
Clear the buffer.
If the gpbitmap is nil, exit.
Lock the gpbitmap given a bitmapdata (24-bit rgb).
Put 1 into a row#.
Put 1 into a column#.
Loop.
If the column# is greater than the bitmapdata's width, put 1 into the column#; add 1 to the row#.
If the row# is greater than the bitmapdata's height, break.
Get a rgb pointer from the bitmapdata at the row# and the column#.
Append the rgb pointer's red byte to the buffer.
Append the rgb pointer's green byte to the buffer.
Append the rgb pointer's blue byte to the buffer.
Add 1 to the column#.
Repeat.
Unlock the gpbitmap given the bitmapdata.
