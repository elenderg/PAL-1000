To duplicate a path to another path in the file system (file):
Privatize the path.
Null terminate the path.
Privatize the other path.
Null terminate the other path.
Call "kernel32.dll" "CopyFileA" with the path's first and the other path's first and 0 returning a number.
Clear the i/o error.
If the number is not 0, set the path to read-write mode; exit.
Put "Error duplicating file '" then the path then "'." into the i/o error.
