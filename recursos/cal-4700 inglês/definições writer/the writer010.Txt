To adjust the text in a shape:
If the shape is nil, exit.
If the shape's kind is not "text", exit.
Put the shape's text rect into a box.
Put the text margin into a margin.
Scale the margin given the shape's scale.
If the shape's border is not clear, add the margin to the box's left.
If the shape's border is not clear, subtract the margin from the box's right.
Change the shape's text given the box.
