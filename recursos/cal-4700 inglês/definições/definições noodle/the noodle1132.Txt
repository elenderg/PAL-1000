To get a selection box given a row and a text (left side):
Put the text's normalized selection into a selection.
Put the text's globalized origin's x into the selection box's left.
If the selection's anchor row# is the row's row#, get a spot given the selection's anchor and the text; put the spot's x into the selection box's left.
Limit the selection box's left to the text's left and the text's right.
