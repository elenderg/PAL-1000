To move the anchor left to any non-alphanumeric byte in a text:
If the text is nil, exit.
Get a row given the text's anchor row# and the text.
Loop.
If the text's anchor column# is 1, exit.
Put the row's string's first plus the text's anchor column# minus 2 into a byte pointer.
If the byte pointer's target is not alphanumeric, exit.
Subtract 1 from the text's anchor column#.
Repeat.
