To dump a buffer into another buffer:
Clear the other buffer.
If the buffer's length is 0, exit.
Slap a substring on the buffer.
Put the substring's first plus 16 minus 1 into the substring's last.
Loop.
If the substring's first is greater than the buffer's last, break.
If the substring's last is greater than the buffer's last, put the buffer's last into the substring's last.
Dump the substring of the buffer into the other buffer.
Move the substring given 16.
Repeat.
