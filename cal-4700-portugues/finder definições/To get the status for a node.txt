To get the status for a node:
If the node is nil, clear the status' string; exit.
Put the node's selected nodette count into a count.
If the count is 0, format the node's nodettes' count and "item" or "items" into the status' string.
If the count is not 0, format the count and "item selected" or "items selected" into the status' string.
If the node is root-level, exit.
If the node's path is read-only, append " (r)" to the status' string.
