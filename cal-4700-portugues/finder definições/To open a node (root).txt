To open a node (root):
Put the accent byte into a byte.
Loop.
Add 1 to the byte.
If the byte is greater than the little-z byte, break.
If the byte is not any valid drive, repeat.
Put the byte then ":\" into a path.
Create a nodette given the path.
Append the nodette to the node's nodettes.
Put the node into the nodette's parent node.
Repeat.
Adjust the node.
