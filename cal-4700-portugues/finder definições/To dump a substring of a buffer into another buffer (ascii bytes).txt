To dump a substring of a buffer into another buffer (ascii bytes):
Slap another substring on the substring.
Loop.
If the other substring is blank, break.
Put the other substring's first's target into a byte.
If the byte is not printable, put the period byte into the byte.
If the byte is the space byte, put the period byte into the byte.
Append the byte to the other buffer.
Add 1 to the other substring's first.
Repeat.
