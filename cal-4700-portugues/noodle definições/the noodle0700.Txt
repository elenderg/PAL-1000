To decide if there is something to remove in a text:
If the text is nil, say no.
If something is selected in the text, say yes.
If the text's caret row# is not the text's row count, say yes.
Get a row given the text's caret row# and the text.
If the text's caret column# is not the row's string's length, say yes.
Say no.
