To handle an event given a text (delete key):
If the text is nil, exit.
If there is nothing to remove in the text, exit.
Remember the text with "delete".
If the event is modified, remove bytes from the text (forward delete with jump).
If the event is not modified, remove bytes from the text (forward delete).
Wrap the text.
Scroll the text to the caret.
