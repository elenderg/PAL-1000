To find a substring in a string given another string:
Slap the substring on the string.
Loop.
If the substring is blank, exit.
If the substring starts with the other string, break.
Add 1 to the substring's first.
Repeat.
Put the substring's first plus the other string's length minus 1 into the substring's last.
