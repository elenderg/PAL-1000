To insert a vertex into a polygon at a spot:
If the polygon is nil, exit.
If the vertex is nil, exit.
Loop.
Get another vertex from the polygon's vertices.
If the other vertex is nil, exit.
If the other vertex's next is nil, exit.
Put the other vertex's spot and the other vertex's next's spot into a line.
If the spot is not on the line, repeat.
Insert the vertex into the polygon's vertices after the other vertex.
