To draw a picture on a gpgraphic at an x coord and a y coord:
If the picture is nil, exit.
If the picture's grayscale flag is set, create a gpimageattributes (grayscale).
Call "gdiplus.dll" "GdipDrawImageRectRectI" with the gpgraphic and the picture's gpbitmap
And the x and the y and the picture's uncropped box's width and the picture's uncropped box's height
And 0 and 0 and the picture's gpbitmap's width and the picture's gpbitmap's height
And 2 [unitpixel] and the gpimageattributes and nil and 0.
If the gpimageattributes is not nil, destroy the gpimageattributes.
