To convert a pointer and a length to a string:
Clear the string.
If the pointer is nil, exit.
If the length is 0, exit.
Reassign the string's first given the length.
Copy bytes from the pointer to the string's first for the length.
Put the string's first plus the length minus 1 into the string's last.
