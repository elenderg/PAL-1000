To decide if a spot is in a polygon:
If the polygon is nil, say no.
Create a vertex array given the polygon's vertices.
Call "gdi32.dll" "CreatePolygonRgn" with the vertex array's spot pointer and the vertex array's count and 2 [winding] returning an hrgn.
Call "gdi32.dll" "PtInRegion" with the hrgn and the spot's x and the spot's y returning a number.
Call "gdi32.dll" "DeleteObject" with the hrgn.
Destroy the vertex array.
If the number is 0, say no.
Say yes.
