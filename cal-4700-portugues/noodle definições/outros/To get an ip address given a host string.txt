To get an ip address given a host string:
Clear the ip address.
Get a sockaddr given the host string.
If the i/o error is not blank, exit.
Put the sockaddr's sin_addr's s_addr into the ip address' number.
Call "ws2_32.dll" "inet_ntoa" with the ip address' number returning a pchar.
Convert the pchar to the ip address' string.
