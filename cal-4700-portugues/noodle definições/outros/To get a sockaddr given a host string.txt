To get a sockaddr given a host string:
Clear the i/o error.
\ prepare strings
Privatize the host string.
Null terminate the host string.
\ get the function addresses
Get some addrinfo routines.
If the i/o error is not blank, exit.
\ get the sockaddr
Put 2 [af_inet] into a addrinfo's ai_family.
Put 1 [sock_stream] into the addrinfo's ai_sockettype.
Put 6 [ipproto_tcp] into the addrinfo's ai_protocol.
Call the addrinfo routines' getaddrinfo with the host string's first and 0 and the addrinfo's whereabouts and a addrinfoptr's whereabouts returning a result number.
If the result number is not 0, put "Could not resolve host name '" then the host then "'." into the i/o error; exit.
If the addrinfoptr is nil, put "Could not resolve host name '" then the host then "'." into the i/o error; exit.
Put the addrinfoptr's ai_addr's target into the sockaddr.
Call the addrinfo routines' freeaddrinfo with the addrinfoptr.
