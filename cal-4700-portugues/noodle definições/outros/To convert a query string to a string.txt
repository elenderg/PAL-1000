To convert a query string to a string:
Clear the string.
If the query string is blank, exit.
Slap a substring on the query string.
Loop.
If the substring is blank, exit.
If the substring's first's target is the cross byte, append " " to the string; add 1 to the substring's first; repeat.
If the substring's first's target is not the percent-sign byte, append the substring's first's target to the string; add 1 to the substring's first; repeat.
If the substring's length is less than 3, exit.
Add 1 to the substring's first.
Convert the substring's first's target to a nibble.
Shift the nibble left 4 bits.
Add 1 to the substring's first.
Convert the substring's first's target to another nibble.
Bitwise or the nibble with the other nibble.
Add 1 to the substring's first.
Append the nibble to the string.
Repeat.
