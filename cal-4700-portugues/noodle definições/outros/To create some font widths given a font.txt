To create some font widths given a font:
Allocate memory for the font widths.
Put the font into the font widths' font.
Put 256 into the font widths' count.
Assign the font widths' data given the font widths' count times a number's magnitude.
Create the hfont of the memory canvas given the font.
Assign an original abc pointer given 256 times an abc's magnitude.
Call "gdi32.dll" "GetCharABCWidthsA" with the memory canvas and 0 and 255 and the original abc pointer.
Destroy the hfont of the memory canvas.
Put the original abc pointer into an abc pointer.
Put the font widths' data into a number pointer.
Loop.
If a counter is past 256, break.
Put the abc pointer's abca into the number pointer's target.
Add the abc pointer's abcb to the number pointer's target.
Add the abc pointer's abcc to the number pointer's target.
Add the abc's magnitude to the abc pointer.
Add the number's magnitude to the number pointer.
Repeat.
Unassign the original abc pointer.
