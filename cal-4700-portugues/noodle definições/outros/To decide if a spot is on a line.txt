To decide if a spot is on a line:
Privatize the line.
Put 3 times the tpp into a number.
Loop.
Get a distance between the spot and the line's center (chessboard).
If the distance is less than or equal to the number, say yes.
Get the distance between the line's start and the line's end (chessboard).
If the distance is less than or equal to the tpp, say no.
Split the line into the line and another line.
Get the distance between the spot and the line's center (chessboard).
Get another distance between the spot and the other line's center (chessboard).
If the distance is greater than the other distance, put the other line into the line.
Repeat.
