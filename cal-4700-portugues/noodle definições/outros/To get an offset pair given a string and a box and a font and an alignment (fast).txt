To get an offset pair given a string and a box and a font and an alignment (fast):
If the alignment is "left", get the offset pair's x given the string and the box (fast - left).
If the alignment is "right", get the offset pair's x given the string and the box  (fast - right).
If the alignment is "center", get the offset pair's x given the string and the box (fast - center).
Call "gdi32.dll" "GetTextMetricsA" with the memory canvas and a textmetric's whereabouts.
Add the box's height minus the textmetric's tmheight divided by 2 to the offset pair's y.
