To convert a string and an actual font info and an original font info into a buffer for pdf output:
Clear the buffer.
Put 0 into a current byte#.
Slap a substring on the first byte of the string.
Loop.
If the substring's first is greater than the string's last, break.
If the substring's last is the string's last, break.
Get a current width given the current byte# and the actual font info's font widths.
Get an original width given the substring's last's target and the original font info's font widths.
Put the original width minus the current width into an offset.
If the offset is 0, add 1 to the substring's last; add 1 to the current byte#; repeat.
Convert the substring to a pdf string.
Append the pdf string then " " then the offset then " " to the buffer.
Put the substring's last plus 1 into the substring's last.
Put the substring's last into the substring's first.
Add 1 to the current byte#.
Repeat.
If the substring's first is greater than the string's last, exit.
Convert the substring to another pdf string.
Append the other pdf string to the buffer.
