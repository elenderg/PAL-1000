To create a gpbitmap given a buffer:
Clear the i/o error.
Call "kernel32.dll" "GlobalAlloc" with 2 [gmem_moveable] and the buffer's length returning a handle.
Call "kernel32.dll" "GlobalLock" with the handle returning a pointer.
Copy bytes from the buffer's first to the pointer for the buffer's length.
Call "kernel32.dll" "GlobalUnlock" with the handle.
Call "ole32.dll" "CreateStreamOnHGlobal" with the handle and 1 [true] and an istream's whereabouts.
Call "gdiplus.dll" "GdipCreateBitmapFromStream" with the istream and the gpbitmap's whereabouts returning a number.
If the number is not 0, put "I don't know how to process this kind of picture." into the i/o error; void the gpbitmap.
Call the istream's vtable's release with the istream.
