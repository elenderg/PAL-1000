To find the next misspelling given a row and a text and a flag:
Clear the flag.
If the text is nil, exit.
If the row is nil, exit.
Slap a rider on the row's string.
If the row's row# is the find anchor's row#, add the find anchor's column# minus 1 to the rider's source's first.
If the rider's source's first is not the row's string's first, skip word characters in the rider's source.
Loop.
Move the rider (spell checking rules).
If the rider's token is blank, exit.
If the rider's token is not misspelled, repeat.
Set the flag.
Put the rider's token's first minus the row's string's first plus 1 into the text's anchor column#.
Put the row's row# into the text's anchor row#.
Put the rider's token's last minus the row's string's first plus 2 into the text's caret column#.
Put the row's row# into the text's caret row#.
