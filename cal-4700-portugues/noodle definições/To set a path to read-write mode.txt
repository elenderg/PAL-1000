To set a path to read-write mode:
Privatize the path.
Null terminate the path.
Call "kernel32.dll" "GetFileAttributesA" with the path's first returning a number.
Bitwise and the number with -2 [everything except file_attribute_readonly].
Call "kernel32.dll" "SetFileAttributesA" with the path's first and the number.
