To send a buffer to a socket:
Clear the i/o error.
Put the buffer's first into a pointer.
Put the buffer's length into a length.
Loop.
If the length is 0, break.
Call "ws2_32.dll" "send" with the socket and the pointer and the length and 0 returning a number.
If the number is -1 [socket_error], put "Error sending data." into the i/o error; exit.
Subtract the number from the length.
Add the number to the pointer.
Repeat.
