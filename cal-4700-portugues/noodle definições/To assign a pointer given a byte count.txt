To assign a pointer given a byte count:
If the byte count is 0, void the pointer; exit.
Privatize the byte count.
Round the byte count up to the nearest power of two.
Call "kernel32.dll" "HeapAlloc" with the heap pointer and 8 [heap_zero_memory] and the byte count returning the pointer.
If the pointer is not nil, add 1 to the heap count; exit.
