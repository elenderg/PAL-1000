To split a buffer into some dyads:

Slap a rider on the buffer.
Loop.
Move the rider given the ampersand byte.
If the rider's token is blank, exit.
Create a dyad. 
Append the dyad to the dyads.
Split the rider's token into a name substring and a query substring given the equal-sign byte.
Put the name substring into the dyad's name.
