To slap a substring on any selected bytes in a row of a text:
Clear the substring.
If the text is nil, exit.
If the row of the text is not selected, exit.
Slap the substring on the row's string.
Put the text's normalized selection into a selection.
If the row's row# is the selection's caret row#, put the substring's first plus the selection's caret column# minus 2 into the substring's last.
If the row's row# is the selection's anchor row#, put the substring's first plus the selection's anchor column# minus 1 into the substring's first.
