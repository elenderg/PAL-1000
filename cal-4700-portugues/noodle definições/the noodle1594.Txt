To move the caret right to any non-symbolic byte in a text:
If the text is nil, exit.
Get a row given the text's caret row# and the text.
Loop.
If the text's caret column# is the row's string's length, exit.
Put the row's string's first plus the text's caret column# minus 1 into a byte pointer.
If the byte pointer's target is not symbolic, exit.
Add 1 to the text's caret column#.
Repeat.
