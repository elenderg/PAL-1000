To extend a box to include another box:
If the other box's left is less than the box's left, put the other box's left into the box's left.
If the other box's top is less than the box's top, put the other box's top into the box's top.
If the other box's right is greater than the box's right, put the other box's right into the box's right.
If the other box's bottom is greater than the box's bottom, put the other box's bottom into the box's bottom.
