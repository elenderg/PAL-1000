To pick some twips between some min twips and some other twips; \ are all these necessary? ***
To pick a number between some min twips and some other twips;
To pick a number between a min number and a max number;
To pick a number from a min number to a max number;
To set a number to something between another number and a third number;
To pick a random number between a min number and a max number:
Put the seed's whereabouts into eax.
\ put address of randseed into ecx
Intel $8BC8. \ mov ecx,eax
\ calculate zero based max
Intel $8B8510000000. \ mov eax,[ebp+16] \ the max
Intel $8B00. \ mov eax,[eax]
Intel $8B9D0C000000. \ mov ebx,[ebp+12] \ the min
Intel $2B03. \ sub eax,[ebx]
Intel $40. \ inc eax
\ adjust randseed
Intel $691105840808. \ imul edx,[ecx],134775813
Intel $42. \ inc edx
Intel $8911. \ mov [ecx],edx
\ mul adjusted randseed by the zero based max
Intel $F7E2. \ mul edx
\ add the min to un-zero base the number
Intel $0313. \ add edx,[ebx] the min
\ store the result
Intel $8B9D08000000. \ mov ebx,[ebp+08] \ the random number
Intel $8913. \ mov [ebx],edx
Put the random number into the context's number.
