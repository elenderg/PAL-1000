To index a type given a name:
If the type is nil, exit.
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Find an existing type given the name and the type index.
If the existing type is nil, index the type given the name and the type index; exit.
Put the type's locus into a locus.
If the locus is nil, put the existing type's locus into the locus. \ point the error to a type in the source code, not a generated type
Abort with "I think I've seen this '" then the name then "' type somewhere before; it must be a duplicate." and the locus.
