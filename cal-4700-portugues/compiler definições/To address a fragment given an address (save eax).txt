Add 6 to the address.
If the fragment's variable is nil, abort with "Internal error - address a fragment given an address (push value)"; exit.
If the fragment's variable's type is nil, abort with "Internal error 2 - address a fragment given an address (push value)"; exit.
Put the fragment's variable's type's length into a length.
If the length is 4, add 2 to the address; exit.
If the length is 2, add 3 to the address; exit.
If the length is 1, add 2 to the address; exit.
Abort with "Internal error 3 - address a fragment given an address (push value)".
