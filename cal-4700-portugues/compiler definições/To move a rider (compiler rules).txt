If the compiler's abort flag is set, clear the rider's token; exit.
Move the rider returning an error string (code rules).
If the error string is not blank, abort with the error string and the rider's token's first; exit.
If the rider's token is blank, exit.
If the rider's token's first's target is noise, repeat.
If the rider's token's first's target is the backslash byte, repeat.
If the rider's token's first's target is the left-bracket byte, repeat.
