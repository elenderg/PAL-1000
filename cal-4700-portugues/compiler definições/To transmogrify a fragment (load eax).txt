To transmogrify a fragment (load eax):
Attach address loading code to the fragment's code given the fragment's variable. \ put address into edx
If the fragment's variable is nil, abort with "Internal error - transmogrify a fragment (load eax)"; exit.
If the fragment's variable's type is nil, abort with "Internal error 2 - transmogrify a fragment (load eax)"; exit.
If the fragment's variable's type's length is not 4, abort with "Internal error 3 - transmogrify a fragment (load eax)"; exit.
Attach $8B02 to the fragment's code. \ mov eax,[edx]
