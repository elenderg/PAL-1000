To compile a term given a rider (possessive - target):
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the term's variable is nil, abort with "Invalid use of target, I don't understand the variable '" then the term's phrase then "'." and the rider; exit.
If the term's type cannot be reduced to "pointer", abort with "You can only get the target of pointer types." and the rider; exit.
Compile the term given the rider (dereference).
