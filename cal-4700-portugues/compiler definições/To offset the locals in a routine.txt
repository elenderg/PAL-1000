To offset the locals in a routine:
If the routine is nil, exit.
If the routine's compiled flag is not set, exit.
Clear the routine's local size.
Loop.
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Get a local from the routine's locals.
If the local is nil, exit.
If the local's previous is not nil, put the local's previous' offset into the local's offset.
Put the local's type's length into a length.
If the local's kind is "scratch", put a pointer's magnitude into the length.
Round the length up to the nearest multiple of 4.
Subtract the length from the local's offset.
Add the length to the routine's local size.
Repeat.
