To calculate the length of a type:
If the type is nil, exit.
If the type's length is not -1, exit.
Calculate the length of the type's base type.
If the type's fields are empty, put the type's base type's length into the type's length; exit.
Put 0 into the type's length.
Loop.
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Get a field from the type's fields.
If the field is nil, exit.
If the field's redefinition target name is not blank, repeat.
Calculate the length of the field's type.
Add the field's type's length times the field's count to the type's length.
Repeat.
