To resolve a type (optional info - pointer):
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the type's target type is not nil, exit.
If the type's target name is blank, put the type's base type's target type into the type's target type; exit.
Find the type's target type given the type's target name and the type index.
If the type's target type is nil, abort with "I can't quite see what you're pointing at. Please clarify." and the type's locus; exit.
