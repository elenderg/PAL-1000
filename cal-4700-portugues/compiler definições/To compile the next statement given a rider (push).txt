If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Move the rider (compiler rules).

If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the expression's variable is nil, abort with "Invalid 'push', I don't understand the variable '" then the expression's phrase then "'." and the rider; exit.
If the expression's type is not value pushable, abort with "Values of type '" then the expression's type's name then "' can't be pushed." and the rider; exit.
