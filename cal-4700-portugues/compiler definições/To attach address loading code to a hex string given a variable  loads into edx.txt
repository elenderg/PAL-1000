To attach address loading code to a hex string given a variable: \ loads into edx
If the variable is nil, attach $C7C200000000 to the hex string; exit. \ mov edx,0
If the variable's kind is "global", attach $C7C2 and the variable's address to the hex string; exit. \ mov edx,the variable's address
If the variable's kind is "literal", attach $C7C2 and the variable's address to the hex string; exit. \ mov edx,the variable's address
If the variable's kind is "local", attach $8D95 and the variable's offset to the hex string; exit. \ lea edx,[ebp+the variable's offset]
If the variable's kind is "scratch", attach $8B95 and the variable's offset to the hex string; exit. \ mov edx,[ebp+the variable's offset]
If the variable's kind is not "parameter", abort with "Internal error - attach address loading code to a hex string given a variable"; exit.
If the variable's by-value flag is set, attach $8D95 and the variable's offset to the hex string; exit. \ lea edx,[ebp+the variable's offset]
Attach $8B95 and the variable's offset to the hex string. \ mov edx,[ebp+the variable's offset]
