To compile the next statement given a rider:
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the rider's token is "if", compile the next statement given the rider (if); exit.
If the rider's token is "loop", compile the next statement given the rider (loop); exit.
If the rider's token is "privatize", compile the next statement given the rider (privatize); exit.
If the rider's token is not the start of any statement, abort with "I was expecting a statement here, but I found '" then the rider's token then "'." and the rider; exit.
Compile the next statement given the rider (other).
If the rider's token is not the period byte, abort with "You seem to have forgotten a period around here." and the rider; exit.
Move the rider (compiler rules).
