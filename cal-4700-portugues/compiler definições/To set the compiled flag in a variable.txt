To set the compiled flag in a variable:
If the variable is nil, exit.
If the variable's compiled flag is set, exit.
Set the variable's compiled flag.
If the variable's kind is not "global", exit.
If the variable's literal is nil, exit.
Find a routine given "put" and the variable's literal's type and "into" and the variable's type.
If the routine is nil, find the routine given "convert" and the variable's literal's type and "to" and the variable's type; set a flag.
If the routine is nil, abort with "The type of this global and the type of its literal are not compatible." and the variable's locus; exit.
Compile the body of the routine.
If the flag is set, put "convert the " then the variable's literal's name then " to the " then the variable's name then ". " into the variable's initializer string.
If the flag is not set, put "put the " then the variable's literal's name then " into the " then the variable's name then ". " into the variable's initializer string.
