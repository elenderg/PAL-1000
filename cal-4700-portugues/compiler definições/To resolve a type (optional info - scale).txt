To resolve a type (optional info - scale):
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Put the type's base type into a base type.
If the type's scale is 0, put the type's base type's scale into the type's scale; exit.
If the base type's scale is 0, exit.
Multiply the type's scale by the base type's scale.
Put the base type's base type into the type's base type.
