To resolve a type (optional info - record):
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the type's fields are empty, copy the type's base type's fields into the type's fields; exit.
Loop.
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Get a field from the type's fields (backwards).
If the field is nil, break.
If the field is duplicated in the type's fields, abort with "The '" then the field's name then "' field is defined more than once." and the field's locus; exit.
Resolve the field.
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the field's type's cooking flag is set, abort with "Recursive definition with '" then the field's type's name then "'." and the field's locus; exit.
Resolve the field's type (optional info).
If the field's reference flag is not set, repeat.
If the field's type cannot be reduced to "pointer", abort with "Exactly what do you mean by '(reference)' here on this '" then the field's name then "'?" and the field's locus; exit.
Repeat.
Eliminate duplicate nicknames from the type's fields.
If the type cannot be reduced to "thing record", exit.
If the type's fields' count is greater than 2, exit.
Copy the type's base type's fields into the type's fields (data fields only).
