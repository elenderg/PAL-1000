To calculate the redefinition offsets in a type:
If the type is nil, exit.
Loop.
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Get a field from the type's fields.
If the field is nil, exit.
If the field's redefinition target name is blank, repeat.
Find another field given the field's redefinition target name and the type's fields.
If the other field is nil, abort with "Invalid redefine. I can't find the '" then the field's redefinition target name then "' field." and the field's locus; exit.
Put the other field's offset into the field's offset.
Repeat.
