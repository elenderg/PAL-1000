To address a variable given an address:
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the variable is nil, exit.
If the variable's compiled flag is not set, exit.
Put the image base plus the address into the variable's address.
Add the variable's type's length to the address.
If the variable's type can be reduced to "string", add the variable's data's length plus 1 to the address.
Round the address up to the nearest multiple of 4.
