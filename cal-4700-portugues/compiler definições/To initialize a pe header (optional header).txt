To initialize a pe header (optional header):
Put 267 [$010B] into the pe header's magicnumber.
Put the code borough's length into the pe header's sizeofcodeinfile.
Put the data borough's length into the pe header's sizeofinitializeddatainfile.
Put 0 into the pe header's sizeofuninitializeddatainfile.
Find a routine given "~initialize before run and run and finalize after run" and the routine index.
If the routine is nil, abort with "Internal error: could not find the startup routine"; exit.
Put the routine's address minus the image base into the pe header's addressofentrypointinmemory.
Put the code borough's base into the pe header's addressofcodeinmemory.
Put the data borough's base into the pe header's addressofinitializeddatainmemory.
Put the image base into the pe header's imagebase.
Put 4096 [$00001000] into the pe header's memoryalignment.
Put 4096 [$00001000] into the pe header's filealignment.
Put 0 into the pe header's reserved.
Put the compiler's exe size into the pe header's sizeofimageinmemory.
Put 4096 [section base] into the pe header's sizeofallheadersinfile.
Put 0 into the pe header's checksum.
Put 0 into the pe header's dllcharacteristics.
Put 1048576 [$00100000] into the pe header's maxstack.
Put 16384 [$00004000] into the pe header's minstack.
Put 1048576 [$00100000] into the pe header's maxheap.
Put 16384 [$00004000] into the pe header's minheap.
Put 0 into the pe header's loaderflags.
