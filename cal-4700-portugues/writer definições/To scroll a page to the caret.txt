To scroll a page to the caret:
If the page is nil, exit.
If the page is not being edited, exit.
Get a box for the caret in the page's edit shape's text.
If the box is not inside the page's edit shape's box, exit.
If the box is inside the page's localized visible box, exit.
Globalize the box given the page's origin.
If the box's left is less than the pad's left, put the pad's left minus the box's right plus the box's width into a difference's x.
If the box's right is greater than the pad's right, put the pad's right minus the box's left minus the box's width into the difference's x.
If the box's top is less than the pad's top, put the pad's top minus the box's bottom plus the box's height into the difference's y.
If the box's bottom is greater than the pad's bottom, put the pad's bottom minus the box's top minus the box's height into the difference's y.
Round the difference to the page's grid.
Add the difference to the page's origin.
