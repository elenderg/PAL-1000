To get a radius given a page:
Put 0 into the radius.
Put the page's first selected shape into a shape.
If the shape is nil, exit.
If the shape's kind is "rectangle", put the shape's rect's radius into the radius.
If the shape's kind is "text", put the shape's text rect's radius into the radius.
Divide the radius by the page's scale.
