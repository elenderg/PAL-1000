Welcome to the Osmosian no-frills communication system!

This is a plain text file with no automatic word wrapping, suitable for many messages.

If you want to send something more elaborate, use the CAL to create a document
and paste that into the recipient's "mailbox" (ie, directory).

Try to keep your "mailbox" empty. Copy incoming messages to your computer,
or file them in your "old o'mails" box.

Don't read other people's mail, and don't share this network address with non-Osmosians.
There is no security, no virus checking, no moderation. We're all on the "honor system" here.
