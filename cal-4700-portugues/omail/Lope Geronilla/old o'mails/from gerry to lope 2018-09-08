C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\ Hello, Lope.

\ My "comments" are in blue in here too. You're still in black.
\ If you want to respond to this in a similar fashion, just delete your previous black lines
\ (so the file won't get too lengthy) and reply to my remaining blue lines in black.

This is great, thank you so much for the welcome!

\ No problem. Glad to have you on board.

I had to take a moment to think about this task.

\ That is not surprising; it's a big job.

I will be hitting on some of these objectives shortly to have a feel for what's ahead.
The way I'll do this is on the next paragraph. Rest assured that my heart is on this.

\ Okay... but I'm going to need a little more detail. I have lots of questions for you.
\ Forgive me if I sound too blunt; I have to make the most of what little time I have.
\ I certainly don't want to discourage you.

My son read a sample of what needs to be translated (page 11) and because of his lack of familiarity with programming terms I will ...

(1) Do the initial translation (from google),

\ The initial translation of what?
\ The whole instruction manual?
\ Or just the handful of articles, conjunctions, prepositions, and keywords on page 11?
\ What about the hundreds of menu commands and error messages?
\ And the hundreds of types and constants in the Noodle?
\ And the 1,700 general-purpose routine headers in the Noodle?
\ And the sample program?
\ And into what language? Italian? Filipino? Tagalog? (Google doesn't translate to Tagalog as far as I know)

(2) Have him read it for improvements.

\ To which of the above does "it" refer?

I also tried to translate to Tagalog (Filipino); I'm a bit rusty. I belong to the 48 million whose second language is Tagalog.

\ Exactly what IS your native language?
\ Where did you grow up? Where do you live?
\ What language do you speak with your family and friends and coworkers?

I still believe this is a secondary goal.  Most Filipinos, especially those with computer access, speak and understand English.
That seems to be true of other countries. I got this quote from somewhere:
"Nearly two billion people - that's almost one in three people - study English as a non-native language."

\ My remarks on this appear below.

So, even if  CAL were just English, it will still usable by many, many people.

\ Ah! If only they WOULD use it!
\ The problem, it seems, is that the CAL is a stand-alone, Windows-only executable,
\ designed to produce similar stand-alone, Windows-only executables.
\ And those are not the kind of programs people want (or want to develop) these days.

I speak another language from the Philippines that is a regional dialect called Ilongo (pronounced Eel-ong-goh).
That means there's potentially a third language I can translate to.

\ Okay... Is Ilongo that the same as Hiligaynon? I couldn't get Google to translate to either one.

I agree with you that this is a gargantuan task. It will be worth it in the end although I felt a bit stirred thinking of the work ahead.

\ Stirred in a good way, I hope.
\ The trick is to reduce the scope to something chewable.
\ As my wife often reminds me, "A small success is more impressive than a big failure."

Since you did not originally plan to have this translated to other languages, it's a big plus that it will translated to some languages.

\ We originally thought that people would translate the whole CAL into other languages, with no English remaining.
\ I still think this is the best way.
\ The SAL, on the other hand, is an experimental Spanish/English hybrid.
\ We might be able to add a third language to the hybrid program, but it would make the program larger and slower.
\ As it stands, the SAL is about 13% bigger than the CAL and recompiles itself in about 5 (rather than 3) seconds.
\ Add too many languages, and the thing will soon be a slow, bloated pig.
\ Besides, what language would appear in the documentation, the sample program, the menus, and the error messages?
\ Making those things user-selectable would definitely make the thing a slow, bloated pig.

There is that other language: programming language. I think I need some hand-holding on some of that stuff, especially the machine code things.

\ I've got no problem with hand-holding. In fact, I enjoy it.

Who's Grand Negi? Scroll bars? What nerve! I'm alright with whatever you have originally designed.
Feel free to nudge me back if you feel I've transgressed off the spirit of your design.

\ So far, I think, we're good.
\ Here's a link to a brief statement of our original goals and my remarks regarding a offshoot that wasn't so good:
\ https://github.com/Folds/osmosian/issues/4

It's your baby after all. I think it will be a long time before I can do any of the sort
as I'll be struggling with the translation and getting it to just run.
Did Pablo start translating around May this year only?

\ Pablo and I have been talking about a "Plain Spanish" compiler for a couple of years.
\ I first proposed the Spanish/English hybrid idea to him at the end of March, 2018.
\ I did almost all the coding (and some of the translating, using Google).
\ Pablo translated the menu commands, the error messages, the types, the constants, and some of the routine headers.
\ He also corrected my translation of the sample program, and translated the instruction manual.
 \ Now he's trying to work it into some of the classes he teaches at several universities in Argentina.

 I know (or hope) there is really no timeline here, but just to have an idea...

\ Proceed at your own pace.

Yes, the CGI. It caught me completely off guard.

\ It's an "undocumented" feature, and we only used it for one application, 'way back in 2006.
\ Most providers don't like non-standard code running on their servers.
\ It's like the problems we have with anti-virus programs, only worse.

It seems that there is a Web--2 going on here with your browser and all.

\ I'm not sure what you mean by "your browser".
\ You're not using a "browser" to read this right now.
\ You're in the CAL's Editor looking at a text file with no extension (like ".txt") on the name,
\ which is why there's no word-wrapping and why the CAL thinks this is Plain English source
\ so I can use the "colorized comment" feature to make my replies blue.
\That's the beauty of this approach; we're using tools that we already had to add a useful feature.
\ Aunt Tilly says, "Good boys!"

Being connected with everybody in the world is not what it's all cracked up to be anyway; although, that was how we met.

\ Indeed, on both points. It seems one must be "IN the world," though not "OF the world," to get things done.

There might be a way to have our connectivity with each other and CAL with the other (bigger) World Wide Web.

\ Sure; ALT-TAB to a browser like Google Chrome when you want to see the World at large.
\ Then ALT-TAB back here where everything is beautiful.

So, in essence I was hoping there was be a CAL running behind a webserver like PHP or Python or Perl does.

\ Sorry, no. But those are not really "real" languages:
\ (a) they are not written in themselves;
\ (b) they don't produce stand-alone executables; and
\ (c) they don't provide unfettered access to the Windows file system.

Forgive me, I'm probably talking heresies; I still have one foot on the previous world after all.

\ It's understandable. The "previous world" is everywhere!

I know of some guy or two having Javascript parsing English project but I got my bet on CAL all the way.

\ I talked to some guys who had a "JEnglish" Kickstarter project a while ago, but they weren't interested in our stuff.
\ I also did some work on a Plain English to Javascript "compiler" upon request, a few years ago,
\ but there were serious incompatibilities that were difficult to overcome.
\ Plain English, for example, passes ALL variables by reference,
\ while Javascript passes simple types by value and others by reference.
\ And such a thing would not be a "real" language, since it would lack the three features mentioned just above.

CAL was really inspired from that cartoon? Amazing.

\ In part, yes. The CAL understands as little as possible, like the dog in the cartoon,
\ so the programmer can define as much as possible for himself.
\ Our other inspiration was Charles Moore's FORTH language;
\ If fact, we used to call Plain English "Readable FORTH".

I was amazed at Eliza, too, when I saw her.
I even programmed an even nicer version of her (in Basic). She's a toy I know.

\ I always like Eliza. In fact (at the risk of getting off topic) I once developed a
\ "Conversational Storytelling" system inspired by Eliza. Here's a link, if you're curious:

Well, enough chit-chat for now, let me feast of the work at hand.

\ Bon appetit!

ps> So I make a copy of this communication and try putting it on your directory (I hope it's in the right place).
I guess from now on this is how we'll communicate (less email).

\ Yep, that's the idea! Just you, me, and the CAL. No email providers, SMTP protocols, no nonsense.
