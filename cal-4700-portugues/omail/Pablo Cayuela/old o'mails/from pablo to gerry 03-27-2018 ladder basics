Dear Gerry,

It is no shame if you don't know about ladder.
I put a ladder basics text for you to see how it is defined.

If you read some of the basics, you will see that ladder does not work with inverter switches that have one common
contact for the both the NO and NC contacts.

As for your useless box circuit I never see it before.
I've seen a video on youtube and found it so funny!

I could make a ladder diagram for it by decomposing every inverter switch on two associated contacts,
but the circuit becomes cumbersome.
And one more thing: ladder are only for control circuits not for power circuits, i.e. the cables outside the PLC.
It is to replace relay control circuits but not the contactors in the power circuits.

I hope that you get the idea of the applications, may be you already know.
