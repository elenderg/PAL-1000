Hello again, Pablo!

I hope all is well with you and yours.

I'm glad you liked the "mathemagician" and other articles. It's fun to program in a natural language,
and to prove it I put another fun program in your mailbox. It's in the "jigsaw puzzle" directory.
You can make it more challenging by making "the piece size" smaller.
Press ESC to quit the program.

Sincerely,

Gerry
