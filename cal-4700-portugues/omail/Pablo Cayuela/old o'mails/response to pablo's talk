Hello, Pablo,

I don't know why you couldn't launch the sudoku solver in the net drive.
And yes, it only does the solving for you. I wrote it for an article I sent to the GeeksForGeeks website.
They haven't published that article yet. But here's one they HAVE published you might enjoy:

I like the O'Mail idea. I'm half Scotch-Irish myself (my mother's maiden name, and my middle name, is McIntyre).

It bothers me that kids think you can't do anything interesting on a computer without CSS and HTML and JavaScript
or Perl or Python or Ruby. Or all of the above, since none of them are able to do much of anything by themselves!
So I'm trying to show that Plain English, all by itself, can do lots of interesting things. Even send and receive O'Mails.

But you haven't said how you like being a Papa. Is everybody well?
Update: I just read my e'mail. I see you are enjoying fatherhood. Glad to hear it, and to hear all are well.

Gerry
