       "I'm not at all surprised to hear that you're a man of the Pascal tradition. And what an honor to speak with Master Wirth himself! Much of our system was inspired by Oberon's simplicity, and much of our compiler was based on Wirth's ""Compiler Construction"" book."

       "Regarding ""wetware"" programming, I can only offer three pieces of advice that I've found in the Bible (and that I've tried to apply myself, with varying success):"

       "1. Proverbs 22:6, ""Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."""
       ""
       "2. Proverbs 13:24, ""Whoever spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him."" I don't recommend beating a BABY with a rod, of course, but I have found that a little physical pain (a tap or a pinch on the buttocks) can be much more effective than 1,000 words."
       ""
       "3. Ephesians 6:4, ""Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."" I'm dealing with this one right now (because Chuckles is almost 13 years old). Funny remark: someone on facebook said, ""I don't want to brag, but I can make my teenager grumpy just by saying Hello."""

       "Now regarding electronics: I've been banned from at least four electronics/physics forums for (persistently) asking the questions on the following page. Perhaps you (or one of your ""C"" electronics students) can answer them for me."

       "1. Everyone agrees that before the battery is connected to the rest of the circuit, the distribution of free electrons in wires A and B is similar: the free electrons in the wires are more-or-less evenly distributed and are randomly drifting around. Yes?"
       " "
       "2. Everyone also agrees that when the battery is connected to the circuit, some of those free electrons begin and continue to move counter-clockwise around the circuit, in concert. These electrons move at a relatively slow pace, but the effect of this movement is felt everywhere almost instantly. Yes?"
       " "
       "3. And while it may not obvious to the average man on the street, every professional assures us that the number of electrons moving past any point in wire B during a given time interval will be equal to the number of electrons moving past any point in wire A during that same time interval. Yes?"
       " "
       "4. Furthermore, assuming that wires A and B are not ridiculously long, everyone agrees that a voltmeter connected between any point on wire A and any point on wire B will indicate a potential difference of about 6 volts. Yes?"
       " "
       "5. Now since there is a potential difference between wires A and B, it seems reasonable to assume that there must be something physically different about these wires, and that a student might want to know what that physical difference is. Yes?"
       " "
       "6. It also seems reasonable to assume that this difference must involve the free electrons in those wires: they must be more in number, or be positioned or spaced differently, or be vibrating or spinning or revolving differently, or be different in some other way. Yes?"
       " "
       "7. So what is physically different about wires A and B when (and after) a fresh battery is connected?"
