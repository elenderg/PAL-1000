Dear Pablo,

\I've setup an arduino with COM12 only sending by now. I've also tried COM11 where I have a virtual serial port;
\in both cases I'm getting an error trying to open the serial port.
\Tell me please about your tests.

I did not test the program; Dan did (in English).
I have ordered the cables I need to duplicate his tests (in Spanish).
Give me a few days and I will send you a full report.
Sorry for the delay.

Tu compañero Quijote,
Gerry
