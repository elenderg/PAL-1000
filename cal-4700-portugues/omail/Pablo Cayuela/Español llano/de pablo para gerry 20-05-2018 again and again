Ok, I'm getting the point, you're right.

I'll take some precautions, not getting on an arms race.

Thank you for your advise.

Dear Pablo,

I'm thinking you may need another Bible verse. A lock is only as good as the next pair of bolt-cutters.

Psalm 127:1: "A menos que el Señor proteja la ciudad, la guardia se despierta, pero en vano."

Reasonable precautions, sure. But keep in mind that the devil wants us spending
our time and energy fighting his henchmen instead of doing God's work
(ie, good, creative, positive, useful things).

Tu compañero peregrino,

Gerry
