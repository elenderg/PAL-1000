Hi Pablo,

I wasn't clear on my last post. I do need a translation of this record:

An event is a thing with
A kind,
A shift flag,
A ctrl flag,
An alt flag,
A spot, \ mouse location on the screen;  the "spot" type is very basic and is used in a lot of places, so pick a short name that you really like
A key, a byte.

Thanks,
Gerry
