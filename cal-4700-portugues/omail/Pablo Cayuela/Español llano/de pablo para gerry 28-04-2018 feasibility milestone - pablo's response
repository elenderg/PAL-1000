\Dear Papa Pablo,

\1. REFERENCES TO FIELDS IN RECORDS:

\In Pascal, we refer to a field within a record using a period, for example...
\box.left
\...where a "box" is a record and "left" is a field in that record.
\In the CAL, we refer to fields within records using 's-style possesives, for example...
\the box's left
\...where a "box" is a record and "left" is a field in that record.
\In the Spanish SAL, we refer to fields within records using prepositional phrases that start with some form of "de", for example...
\la izquierda del cuadro
\...where "izquierda" is a field in a "cuadro" record.
\So the SAL will misunderstand the Spanish names below...

\\input/output error  ->  error de Entrada/Salida
\\i/o error   ->   error de e/s 
\...and will treat the "de" as a name-ender, and will object that "de" was not followed by an article.
Ok, then we could use the simple "error e/s" or "error entrada/salida" as a name; for the description in text we could add "de".

\We have a similar problem in the CAL where the preposition "of" is a name-ender and thus names like...
\the count of students
\...are invalid.

\Perhaps we can think of a simple way to fix these problems in the future, but for now:
\"DE" IS NOT ALLOWED IN NAMES.
We could avoid some words "de" for simplicity right now; it is easy to understand but when it becomes possible we prefer to read the "de".
In some replies I only translated without checking if it was for names, even for you to read the correct Spanish form. Just take away the "de"s. Sorry.

\2. \Please show me the sentences that your are getting "se" in google.
\I can't remember them all, but here is an example:
\If the work is not completed, exit. -> Si el trabajo no se completa, salga.
Si el trabajo no se completa, ... \ It is good Spanish. The best sounding.
Alt. transl.:
Si el trabajo está incompleto, ... \ Like previous one.
Si el trabajo no está completo, ... \ Fair.

This form of "se" is a reflexive pronoun but as you proposed we could treated as a variant for is -> es/se. We could try.

Wrong ones:
Si el trabajo es no completo.
Si el trabajo está no completo.
Si el trabajo es no completado.
Si el trabajo está no completado.
Si el trabajo es/está incompletado.

\And "salga" should be "salida," since "salga" doesn't just exit the current routine, it ends the program altogether.
Exit could be "termina". Salida is not so clear. Salga could is better, is an order (imperative form of "salir", to exit).
But "termina" is both "it finish/ends" and imperative "you, finish/end".

\3. COLOR NAMES

\I'm wondering if the Spanish color names would be easier to remember using a scheme more like this:

\el color rojo clarísimo       -> el color rojo muy muy claro
\el color rojo claro              -> el color rojo muy claro
\el color rojo claro              -> el color rojo claro
\el color rojo                       -> el color rojo
\el color rojo opaco           -> el color rojo oscuro
\el color rojo oscuro          -> el color rojo muy oscuro
\el color rojo oscurísimo   -> el color rojo muy muy oscuro

\Or would that be too unnatural?
No, is better than what I proposed (mine is made up), except for superlatives that are correct and could be an alternative form like in English for endings "-est" -> "-ísimo".
The "muy muy" is correct also. I proposed to keep your scheme and add "-ísimo" superlatives.

\4. MENU COMMAND NAMES
\Since I can't read the Spanish command names on the menus, I get by in the SAL by using shortcut keys for most things.
\But when I have to get a command off a menu, it strikes me odd that, for example,
\Cerrar Todo is under "C" (matching the verb)
\Guardar Todo is under "G" (matching the verb)
\Selecciona Todo is under "S" (matching the verb)
\...but...
\Todo Mayúsculas is under "T"
\Todo Mayúsculas is under "T"

Obviously we run out quickly of letters for shortcuts.
Then they have no meaning, and whatever you choose the user needs to learn it that way.

But...
Guardar/Cerrar/Selecciona(r) Todo
verb + adverb

Todo Mayúsculas/Mayúsculas
Adverb + Noun
There is no verb in the command, sorry, we could not use that noun for verb.

\...
In a next answer, the rest.
