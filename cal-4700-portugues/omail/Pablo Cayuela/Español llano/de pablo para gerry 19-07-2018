Querido Gerry:

\Perhaps you need to re-read (at least) the first two articles on our blog:
\https://osmosianplainenglishprogramming.blog
I really don't remember to know about that blog:
\...
\Note that in this case we have both the highest and lowest of languages — Spanish, English and machine code (in hexadecimal) — in a single sentence!
\The insight here is that a program should be written primarily in a natural language, with snippets of code in more appropriate syntax as (and only as) required.
\Like a typical math book: mostly natural language with formula snippets interspersed.

\We hope someday the technology will be extended, at the high end, to include Plain French, Plain German, etc;
\and at the the low end to include “snippet parsers” for the most useful, domain-specific languages.

If we could link Speech Recognition with Plain English we could go ahead.

\If your audience is not impressed with (or at least curious about) THAT, I don't think you'll ever win them over.
\Please take another look at those articles; I wrote them with "technical" people in mind.
I'm enjoying to read from it. Specially the story about Perspective.

\But feel free to do as you think best. I'm on your side whatever you do.

\\And also I wonder how to interface Español llano (even Plain English) to an Arduino, like your project with the Maze Solver.
\The LEGO Maze was easy to interface because the pc-control.uk people wrote a Windows DLL that we could call
\to talk to their devices.

\\I guess the hardware driver are key to this but many kits work thru simple USB-RS232.
\I'm pretty sure that Windows has built-in functions that will let us talk to a USB port as if it was a serial port.
\But I will have to get Dan to hunt them down and wrap them up for us.
\And we will need a circuit of some kind to test them with.
\I will talk to Dan about this.
If we program an Arduino with a simple program that checks the port to receive instructions, we could use it as an expansion board
preprogrammed with some sensor readings and outputs activation beforehand. Just thinking!

\\In the meantime, I will finish the revision of Glossary.
\Good idea. Each of the five "technical" things you listed above is covered there:
\1. HABILIDADES BÁSICAS, page 83 (assignments)
\2. CONDICIONALES, page 63 (conditionals) 
\3. LAZOS, page 90 (loops)
\4. PROCEDIMIENTOS, page 101 and FUNCIONES, page 81 (routines)
\5. DECIDERS, page 72 (deciders)
You're right. I'll check it and make some examples.

\God bless you and your family. How is Martín Amín progressing? How old is he now?
\Gerry
Martín Amín is progressing so much that makes us wonder how awake he is.
He is almost half year old.

Pablo.
