Dear Papa Pablo,

The SAL-1006 now allows "de" in names (if "de" is not followed by an article).
But it is not clear when to use it. For example, Google adds "de" when it translates...

\ the abandonar button -> el botón de abandonar

...but Google leaves out "de" when it translates:

\ the print button -> el botón imprimir

¡confuso!

I've also got all those i/o error messages you translated into the SAL-1006, but the change...

i/o error -> error de e/s

...will have to wait for the SAL-1007 since the SAL-1005 (that I use to compile the SAL-1006)
doesn't know how to handle "de" in names. And THAT is probably as confusing to you
as Spanish is to me!

Anyway, thanks for translating all those mesages. And thanks for all your help and encouragement.

Tu amigo, Gerry
