Dear Pablo:

Below are the 137 lines from the Desktop that install commands on the SAL's menus.
I need your preferred Spanish translations for the command names (the string immediately following the word 'add' in each line).
Some of them have shortcut keys following the command name. These also need to be translated.
Change the command names (and shortcut keys) below, and I'll copy and paste them into el escritorio de la SAL-1002.
The rest of each line should be left in English, at least for now.
