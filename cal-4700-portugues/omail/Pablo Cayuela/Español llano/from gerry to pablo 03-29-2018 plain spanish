\Hello again, Papa!

\I know you are very busy these days (and so am I). But are you still interested in Plain Spanish?
\I was fooling around with an idea last night, and I got this to compile and run:

Para correr:
Puesta en marcha.
Hacer cosas increíbles.
Apagar.

Para hacer cosas increíbles:
Borrar la pantalla.
Espera la clave de escape.

\My problem is that I don't know if that is good or bad Spanish.

\I also have a problem with Google's translator, because it doesn't give me consistent results. For example:

Put the screen's right into the box's right.
Put the screen's bottom into the box's bottom.

\Translates to...

Coloque la pantalla a la derecha en la casilla de la derecha.
Pon la parte inferior de la pantalla en la parte inferior de la caja.

\...with two different words for "put" ("Coloque" and "Pon").
\And with the possessive (screen's) apparently translated in two very different ways.
\It also appears that the word "key" translates differently when it's part of a sentence:

the escape key
the escape key is a key equal to 27.

\...translates to:

la clave de escape
la tecla de escape es una clave igual a 27.

\Wow. I thought English was a goofy language!

\Another thing: How do you type letters with the accent marks above them?
\To get that special "í" in "increíbles," for example, I have to hold ALT and enter 0237. Not very convenient.
\Are the accent marks important?

\If you don't have time for this, or don't think it's worth the effort, I understand.
\On the other hand, if you'd like to chip away at it, little by little, I'm your man.
\I think we could probably have a basic Plain Spanish compiler working in about a year.
\Any idea what would we do with it, once it was complete?

\Gerry
