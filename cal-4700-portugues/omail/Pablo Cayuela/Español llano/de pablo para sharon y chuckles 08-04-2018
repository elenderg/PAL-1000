Dear Sharon and Chuckles,

\Sharon thanks you for the kiss. She asks you to kiss the baby for her.
The baby has received your kiss. May be soon I will send a mini video with him laughing by email.
\She wants to know what city you live in so Chuckles can put a pin in the map as part of his home-school geography studies.
We live in Cordoba city (ciudad de Córdoba), capital of Cordoba province of Argentina, about the south middle of the country.
Both Patricia and me are salteños from province of Salta in the north of the country, but Martín Amín is a cordobés.

The address of are house is Calle Pública A 325 Casa 153, Barrio Parque Horizonte Sur.
In Google maps our coordinates are 31°27'52.3"S 64°12'24.0"W.
You could even see my house in Google Street, in the picture it could be seen a red wine colored car inside a garage without roof
with the same color bars on the front.

I hope Chuckles is doing good at school.

Kisses!

Pablo
