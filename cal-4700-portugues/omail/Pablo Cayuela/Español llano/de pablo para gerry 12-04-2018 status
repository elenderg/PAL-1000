Dear Gerry,

Forced slowing down...
Martin have some fever after vaccines, a lot of work, travel to another city, family visiting us, father's birthday, etc.
Hope to get back to Español Llano, may be in a few days.

Un abrazo.
Pablo

Dear Pablo,

I haven't heard from you in a few days. Is everything okay?

Gerry
