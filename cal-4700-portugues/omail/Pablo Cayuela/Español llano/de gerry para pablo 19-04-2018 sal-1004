Amigo Papa Pablo,

1. I'm putting the "SAL-1004" into your mailbox.

2. I'm also including the "SAL-1003a" (note the "a" on the end) which is able to compile it.

3. I'm also including a test program, "#11 comprobador de eventos", for looking at the events your keyboard generates.

¡I'm happy to say that this test program is written entirely in Spanish!

I commented the "reponer cursor" event because there are too many of them generated.

*** You must "CLIC DERECHO DOBLE" to quit the test program. ***

Let me know what events are generated when you:

a. Press ALT GR
b. Press  ALT GR + a key with a third symbol, like "\"

Gracias,

Gerry

PS. I'll put the ASCII byte globals into the SAL-1005 when you've got the rest of the list translated.
No rush. I just wanted to get to work fixing this Spanish keyboard problem.

PPS. The SAL-1004 is still incomplete and probably full of bugs. But use it as much as you can so we can
see where we need to fix it.
