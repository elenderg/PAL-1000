Hello again, Papa Pablo!

Such a beautiful boy! Thanks for the videos; I will show them to Sharon and Chuckles in the morning.
(I am working while they are sleeping and it is quiet.)

Will they let you present a paper at the VIII Congreso Internacional de la Lengua Española?
I think that would be good, and a lot of fun.
Imagine the look on the faces of all those experts when you show them what can be done
with a program as stupid as Gary Larson's dog! Whatever help you need, I'm your man.

The SAL-1010 and the Sal Monet 1010 are in your mailbox.

All of the changes you suggested are in there, except for the following:

1. I used "adjuntar" instead of "añadir" since the idea is not just to "add" a link to a chain,
but to "attach" a link to a chain. And because I can type it more easily because it doesn't include an accent mark. 
If that is not good, just let me know and we can change it.

2. I used "advanzar" instead of "iniciar" because "bump a rider" doesn't "start" it, but rather
"nudges" or "advances" it one byte further along.
Again, if that is not good, just let me know and we can change it.

Both of the above are defined in el seso, not el compliador, so we can easily change them later.
Even put in more than one alternative for convenience. But for now we need to keep the
SAL, the Sal Monet, and the Instruction Manual as simple and consistent as possible.

Next steps:
(a) Translate the Gray Matter Glossary (pages 56-118 of the Instruction Manual), and
(b) update El Seso del SAL to match.

That's 63 pages. 63 hours if we work day and night and don't run into any big problems;
63 days if we take time to eat and sleep and talk with our wives and play with our sons;
63 weeks if we don't care about missing the VIII Congreso Internacional de la Lengua Española
in 2019.

So we should probably try to do at least a couple of pages a week. Yes?

Tu compañero quijote,

Gerry
