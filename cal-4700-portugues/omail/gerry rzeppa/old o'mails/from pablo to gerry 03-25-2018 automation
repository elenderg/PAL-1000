Dear Gerry,

Thank you for the advices about raising sons.

I leave a file in your directory with my English version of my two pages on automation; just as I say before
the 4 circuits are: serial, parallel, and inverter (NC: normally closed) for inputs, outputs and memory relays
(except serial for outputs), and start/stop circuit. That's all (well, you later add both counters and timers as blocks but
they act as outputs and new input conditions).
In my two pages I explain how to use it.

I hope you find what is my driving thought. Simplicity: few elements and finite combinations, then many instances
of every input and memory relays as needed, and only one circuit for the activation of every output.

Pablo Cayuela
PS: Later I will try to annalize your questioned circuit.
