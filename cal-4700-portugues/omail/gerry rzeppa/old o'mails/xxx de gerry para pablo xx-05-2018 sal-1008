Hello again, Papa Pablo!

I've put the 1009 version of both the SAL and the SAL MONET into your mailbox.

The major changes/improvements are:

- "De" is allowed in names if not followed by an article, for example "el error de e/s".
- El error de e/s messages are now in Spanish; the global variable "i/o error" is now called "error de e/s".
- "Nula" and "nulo" can now be used in place of "nil"
- "A spot" is now "un punto".
- Decider routines can be called in their negative form using "no" BEFORE the verb, for example "Si el trabajo no es completa, salir."
- Decider routines can be terminated with "diga si" or "diga no" or just "di no".
- New local variables can be created "on the fly" when setting a field, for example "Poner 15 mm en la coordenada-y de un punto."
- The special, hard-coded fields (target, magnitude and whereabouts) now have Spanish names (objectivo, magnitud, paradero).
- All the general-purpose Spanish types, globals, and routine headers needed by the Sal Monet have been integrated into the 1008 el seso.
- The simplified color names have been implemented
- "Mayúsculas Todo" and "Minúsculas Todo" now appear after "Mayúscula Inicial" on the "M"  menu.
- The keywords for loops are now "LAZO, INTERRUMPTIR, SALIR, and REPETIR."
- The routine that quits a program (and the button that quits the Sal Monet) are now called "Abandonar", matching the command under the "A" menu.
- Function-type routines can now be defined in Spanish, for example "Para poner el centro de un cuadro en un punto:"

If the 1009 version is acceptable to you, el compilador is now complete, and our two remaining tasks are:

1. Translate the rest of the Instruction Manual (especially the "Gray matter Glossary"); and
2. Add Spanish types, globals, and routine headers in el seso to match.

PS. Did you notice that Google is smart enough to handle Spanish subject names in the Sal Monet?
For example, you can ask it to draw "bananas" or "plátanos".
