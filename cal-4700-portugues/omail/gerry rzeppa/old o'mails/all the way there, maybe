As you noticed, it doesn't appear that any thing special needs to be done to make the reverse-possessive
calling of functions work. That was already implemented when I did the initial reverse-possessive work.

The multiple headers also seem to work on functions:

to put the middle uv a box into a spot;
to put a box's center into a spot:

You can NOT say:

to put the center uv a box into a spot;
to put a box's center into a spot:

because you're essentially defining the same thing twice. Just like you currently can't say:

to draw a box;
to draw a box:

But it should work with Spanish since the words are different. It doesn't appear I have all the right bits
to test that.

Let me know what doesn't work.
