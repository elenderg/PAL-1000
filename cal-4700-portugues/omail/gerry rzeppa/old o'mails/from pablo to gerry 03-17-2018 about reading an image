Dear Gerry,

I saw in the jigsaw puzzle program that for reading an image you use a large (ascii) hex string.
How do you obtain that representation? From an hex editor/converter? Is there a way to read a raw file?

Here at home we are really glad with our new life with our son, it's really a blessing.

Your friend,
