Querido Gerry:

\Dear Papa Pablo,

\Thank you for the "retouched" version of the Sal Monet 1005.
\Those are exactly the kind of corrections/adjustments we need.
Oh lucky for me!

\I have made a lot of changes since I sent the 1005 to you, however,
\so it will take me a day or two to integrate your corrections/adjustments
\into the current version (which is now 1009, and will probably be 1010 by the
\time Dan gets back to me with the final "big" compiler change).
I can wait patiently,  no hurry.

\I think I understand all the changes you've made, and have even anticipated
\some of them. "Nula" or "nulo" for "nil", for example. The reason you couldn't find
\a definition for "nil" is that it was magically "inherited" from a definition in the
\original version of the compiler. Dan has tried to explain it to me several times, but
\I still don't understand it myself.

\Other corrections, I must admit, should not have been necessary; even I know that it
\should be "del evento" and not "de la evento". I'm learning. But I will probably make that
\same kind of mistake again.
Yes I know Gerry but for you to read the correct form and for us to read it well.

\Here are some of the other changes/improvements that have already been implemented:

Wow! \- "de" is allowed in names if "de" is not followed by an article, for example "el error de e/s".
So good! \- i/o error messages are now in Spanish; the global variable "i/o error" is now called "error de e/s".
Fine. \- "A spot" is now "un punto" instead of "un foco".
Really good! Si el trabajo no está completo, salir. \- "Nay sayers" (I like that term) can now be called using "no" BEFORE the verb, for example "Si el trabajo no es completa, salir."
Good option for many Spanish speakers. \- Decider routines can be terminated with "diga si" or "diga no" or just "di no".
\- New local variables can be created "on the fly" when setting a field, for example "Poner 15 mm en la coordenada-y de un punto." (which creates a new local variable of type punto)
Watch out: objetivo w/o "c", lost ages ago. "Paradero" a beautiful word. \- The special, hard-coded fields (target, magnitude and whereabouts) now have Spanish names (objectivo, magnitud, paradero).
Ok. \- The keywords for loops are now "LAZO, INTERRUMPTIR, SALIR, and REPETIR."
Ok. \- All the general-purpose Spanish types, globals, and routine headers needed by the Sal Monet have been integrated into the 1008 el seso.
Fine. Superlatives for future SAL or added by programmer. \- The simplified color names have been implemented
Not bad. \- The routine that quits a program (and the button that quits the Sal Monet) are both now called "Abandonar", matching the command under the "A" menu.
Ok. \- "Mayúsculas Todo" and "Minúsculas Todo" now appear after "Mayúscula Inicial" on the "M"  menu.

\I'm waiting for Dan to complete the necessary changes to support "function-style" routines, for example...

\Para poner el centro de un cuadro en un punto:

\...which makes "el centro" look to the programmer like just another field in "un cuadro" record,
\and which can be "nested" inside other statements, such as

\Dibujar el centro del cuadro con el color rojo.

\The compiler makes two calls in a case like this (which is why we need Dan to show us how it is done):

\1. A call to the "poner el centro de un cuadro en un punto" function, then
\2. A call to the normal "dibujar un punto con un color" routine.

I can't follow you nor Dan. Hope to get it with use and time.

\If all goes well, the SAL-1010 should mark the end of major changes to the compiler, with
\only changes to el seso and the documentation still to go.
\I will send the 1010 to you as soon as Dan is finished and I have made sure his changes work in Spanish.
\Tu amigo,
\Gerry
I'll wait.

\PS. Note that "To decide if a counter is past a number" is not just a simple comparison
\like "To decide if a counter is greater than a number" since it increments the counter
\before checking. So the compound verb "is past" should be special in some way.
A new try out.
A better wording with almost literal translation but ambiguous enough sense could be:
Para decidir si un contador se pasa de un número; \continuous present; it had a sense to check now or to try a modification to the counter and then check
Para decidir si un contador supera un número; \continuous present; same as before
To decide if a counter is past a number:


"está pasado (de)" is also something that has ended the action (verb to be in present but auxiliar verb in past) or "se pasó (de)" aux "se" + verb in past
"se pasa (de)" is a description of right now but is also in pasive voice for Spanish with auxiliar "se" + verb in present

"supera" instead of "superó"
continuous present -it exceeds-  versus past -it exceeded-.

\PPS. Did you notice that Google is smart enough to handle Spanish subjects in the Sal Monet?
\You don't, for example, have to ask it to paint "bananas"; you can ask it to paint "plátanos".
Ah, yes, Google have already using search in many languages; it seems that start with regional language (set in OS) then with English, etc.

\PPPS. How old is Martin now? Is he rolling over? sitting up? learning to type?
Three months in two days.
He does not rolling over but babbling, and that amazes us.
He is beyond typping! He sits with help and becomes our new laptop!

New laptop programmer Pablo.
