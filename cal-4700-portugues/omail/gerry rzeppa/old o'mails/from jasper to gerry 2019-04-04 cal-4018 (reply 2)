Gerry,

CAL-4018 has some modest changes:
 * The turtle can now
   "fade a line a length long from a color to another color".

\ Interesting feature. Did you need this to produce a particular drawing?

I wrote a "splash a color" turtle demo to figure out
some issues with measuring the differences between colors,
and with picking "a color near a color".
The drawing has a 1 inch diameter dot in the middle,
with 96 fat lines radiating out from the dot's perimeter.
The length of each line is proportional to
the measured difference in color between its ends.
A dE-2000 difference of 10 is one inch.
The drawing also has white circles with 2, 3, and 4-inch
diameters; they provide a scale for the dE-2000 measurements.
The effect is similar to the starburst in the Osmosian logo,
but with a 1 inch dot instead of a central point.

The drawing helped me choose 13-1/2 for the value of
a color difference that produces colors that are "near" enough.

The "fade" feature has two benefits for this drawing:
It makes the color variation be roughly proportional
to radius, and it helped me diagnose a few bugs
in the code to choose a color partway from one color
toward another.

Here is the demo code:

To run:
  start up.
  initialize the context.
  save the context.
  pick a color. splash the color. wait 3 seconds. reset the context.
  finalize the context.
  shut down.

to splash a color:
  clear the screen.
  draw concentric circles.
  make a dot 1 inch wide.
  center the dot in the screen's box.
  draw the dot with the color.
  refresh the screen.
  start in the center of the screen's box facing north.
  use the fat pen.
  loop.
    pick another color near the color.
    measure a delta ratio between the color and the other color.
    remember where we are.
    move 1/2 inch.
    put 1/10 inch in a length.
    multiply the length by the delta ratio.
    use the other color.
    fade a line the length long from the color to the other color.
    refresh the screen.
    go back to where we were.
    turn right 1/96 of the way.  
    add 1 to a count.
    if the count is greater than 96, break.
  repeat.

to draw concentric circles: 
  use the white pen.
  use the thin pen.
  start in the center of the screen's box facing north.
  move left 1 inch.
  draw a circle 2 inches wide.
  move left 1/2 inch.
  draw the circle 3 inches wide.
  move left 1/2 inch.
  draw the circle 4 inches wide.
  move right 2 inches.
  refresh the screen.
