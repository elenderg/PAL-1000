Querido Gerry:

Last week I was finishing classes of Programming 101 for freshmen.
As a final practice, after Spanish pseudocoding and C++ programming with sequence, conditionals, loops and functions,
I've asked the better ones to try Español Llano, to recreate Sal-Monet and make a new program.

I left copies of best works in my directory for you to check.
None of them are wonderful but at least I got some feedback from begginers with Español Llano.

As a side note, we have quarantined for over 3 months and still in it.
I've been giving a lot of classes via web from home, I'm a lucky one having a continuous job.

My father fortunately this year is in better shape, and the rest of my family are doing well despite being in quarantine as well.

I hope you and your great family are also doing well in this hard time.

Un abrazo grande para vos y tu hermosa familia.

Pablo Cayuela
