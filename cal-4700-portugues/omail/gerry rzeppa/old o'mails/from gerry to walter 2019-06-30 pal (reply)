\ Hello Walter!

\ Sorry for the delay in responding; I've been so busy on other projects that I forgot to check my o'mail.

Yes, I am comparing SAL source codes with their corresponding CAL-3040 to analyze the differences. It's really amazing.

\ I hope that Pablo someday finds the time to convert the whole SAL to Spanish. I like the fact that the SAL is
\ is bi-lingual, but separate compilers for each natural language will make each system smaller, simpler and more
\ efficient.

Yes, the intent is just to make the language available in the Plain English collection.

\ Have you thought of a name for the Portuguese version? Google translates "Plain Portuguese" into "Português Puro",
\ but I have no idea if that is a good name. I'm not even sure "Español Llano" is the right name for the Spanish version.
\ If it helps, the "Plain" in "Plain English" means "simple, ordinary, normal -- something every English-speaking person can
 \ understand. PAL is fine for the program name.

Big hug and best regards.

\ The same to you.

\ Gerry

\ PS. You probably noticed that there is no word-wrap in here, because we're using the program editor to compose
\ mesages. Not exactly convenient, but it does allow me to put my responses in blue by making them "comments".

\ PPS. Some time ago I started writing a book called "How to Write a Plain English Compiler in Plain English".
\ I only got as far as page 3, but I've put a copy of those pages in your o'mail box since you might find some of the
\ information helpful.
