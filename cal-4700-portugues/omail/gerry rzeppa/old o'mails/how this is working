For your information, the technology behind these cloud folders is called WebDAV.

It's a standard for accessing a file system over the HTTP protocol.

The webserver that is hosting the osmosian.com website, supports it, so I just turned it on.

That ugly string I had you paste into your command prompt just mapped the network drive
on your computer to the server. You may or may not have noticed that there was a user
name (osmosian) and password (osmosian) in there.

I'm pretty sure it can be configured so that you don't need a username or password, but 
then there's a pretty high chance that some hackker kid in China will find it and either delete everything,
put a virus in there, or fill it up with junk and crash the server.

As you've probably noticed, anyone can read/write anyone elses directories. How do you see the security
working in this Alternet?

For example, someone, could replace the cal-4700.exe with one that contains a virus.
