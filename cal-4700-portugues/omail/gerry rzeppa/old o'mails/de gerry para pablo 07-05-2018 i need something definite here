Dear Papa Pablo,

\The rule that you guess I find it correct for our purposes, that "a" followed by definite article could be treated as an English preposition:

\a + la + fem. noun
\a + el + masc. noun -> al + masc. noun

\Contraction "al" from "a+el", similar to "del=de+el".
\Old Spanish use "a el" but we read it as well as "al".

\I didn't evaluate if "a" followed by indefinite article would be treated as an English preposition:

\a + una + fem. noun
\a + un + masc. noun

I will see what I can do with "a" tonight, and send you updated 1012 files.
It's the contractions that are the problem. But that's not surprising, since even Data,
the advanced Android on "Star Trek the Next Generation," had trouble with contractions.

\I like all of them:
\caja: common word
\cuadro: more technical
\rectángulo: pretty common and technical word

That's great, and the SAL can support all of them as synonyms.
But note: We use "rect" as short for  "rectangle" in the Writer, and it is something different than a simple box.

*** ATENCIÓN / IMPORTANTE: ***

I need to know which word you want as the primary word for box; the word that will appear in the
Sal Monet (18 times) and the full Instruction Manual (about 145 times) and El Seso (many  more times).
There are only 59 total occurrences now, but there will be too many to conveniently change later.
It's not easy changing them because the articles (including contractions) have to change as well.

\ Pablo el lenguaraz.

I'm still having trouble translating that. The linked page is in Spanish and Google doesn't translate it well.
Is it "a person who has mastered two languages"? or, "a person who dares to speak two languages"?

In either case, we should call the bilingual SAL, "Sal Lenguaraz" :)

Tu amigo,

Gerry
