Gerry:

\ Or we could handle the exception at the top of the routine with a sentence like this:

If the original number is the smallest number, put "-2147483648" into the string; exit.

\ Now that I think about it, we could handle all the conversions that way.
\ Just kidding.

\ I'll put this on the fix list.

\Thanks,

Yes, your solution works just fine.  The reason I didn't do it that way
is that one place where I convert the smallest number to a string
is in a test that verifies that "to convert a number to a string"
works correctly.

P.S.  I'll adopt your solution, and add another test.
      That will keep the main code easy-to-read,
      and acknowledge that the smallest number is a special case.
      (Either way, it is a special case.)
