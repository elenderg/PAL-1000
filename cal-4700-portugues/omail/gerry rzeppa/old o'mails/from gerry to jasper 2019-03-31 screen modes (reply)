\ Thanks. Every bit of insight helps me understand others better.

\ Related anecdote:

\ I know a guy named David who is teaching another guy named Jorge
\ to program websites using HTML and JavaScript. Jorge is a rank
\ beginner, but David keeps feeding him mixed HTML/JavaScript exercises
\ even though Jorge seems confused. Personally, I would teach HTML separately
\ first, and later, when Jorge had a grasp of HTML, move on to JavaScript.

\ But here's the kicker: It turns out that David doesn't "see" HTML and
\ JavaScript as two distinct languages with two differing syntaxes.
\ In his mind, for example, these two lines of code...

function run( ) { a=window.prompt("Give me a number") }

<BODY style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:18pt" onload="run()">

\ ...are just different parts of one big web-programming language.

\ Well, at least now I know why he wasn't impressed when I pointed out that
\ whole programs can be created in Plain English using just one and the same
\ simple and familiar syntax.

\ I think this also sheds some light on why he wasn't impressed when I pointed out 
\ that in Plain English I can design, code, test, and document a program with
\ just a single application (the CAL), while he needs a separate drawing program,
\ editor, browser, and word processor to do the same thing. He doesn't "see" those
\ things as separate programs; they're all just different overlapping "windows" to him.

\ Thus the old saying, "User friendly is what the user is used to."
