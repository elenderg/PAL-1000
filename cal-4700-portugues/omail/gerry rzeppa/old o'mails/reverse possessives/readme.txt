Find "\ TODO: alphabetize me" to see the major changes.

You have to use "uv" when doing a reverse-possessive. As in "the left uv the box".
I haven't dug too much into if this could be changed, but the noodle doesn't compile trying to use "of".

Turns out that "deep" fields still work without any extra effort.
So you can say "the left uv the page" instead of "the left uv the box uv the page".
