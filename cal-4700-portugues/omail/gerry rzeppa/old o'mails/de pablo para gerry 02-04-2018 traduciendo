¡Hola Gerry!

I'm trying to do the task:

\Hola, Papa!

\Please read my other "01-04-2018 why it is easy to convert plain english to español llano" post first.

\Since Plain English and Español Llano allow spaces in type, variable, and routine names,
\(unlike every other programming language on the planet!) we need to know where those names begin and end.
\We use the following routines (and some others, already translated) to help us do that
\(the string in each case is the current token that the parser has extracted from the source code):

\To decide if a string is any name starter: \ compare with name ender
\If the string is any mark, say no.
\If the string is any symbol, say no.
\If the string is any article, say no.
\If the string is any conjunction, say yes.
\If the string is any possessive, say no.
\If the string is any verb, say yes.
\If the string is any operator, say yes.
\If the string is any preposition, say yes.
\If the string is any qualifier, say no.
\If the string is any literal, say no.
\If the string is "called", say yes. \ as in "...20 bytes CALLED filler"
\If the string is "equal", say yes. \ an in "...is a byte EQUAL to 13. 
\If the string is blank, say no.
\Say yes.

\To decide if a string is any name ender: \ compare with name starter
\If the string is any mark, say yes.
\If the string is any symbol, say yes.
\If the string is any article, say yes.
\If the string is any conjunction, say yes.
\If the string is any possessive, say yes.
\If the string is any verb, say yes.
\If the string is any operator, say yes.
\If the string is any preposition, say yes.
\If the string is any qualifier, say yes.
\If the string is any literal, say yes.
\If the string is "called", say yes.
\If the string is "equal", say yes.
\If the string is blank, say yes.
\Say no.

To decide if a string is any verb: \ only used in decider headers and IF statements

If the string is "ser", say yes. \ "be": note that Spanish have both verbs for "to be": infinitive "ser" for permanent attribute
If the string is "estar", say yes. \ "be": note that Spanish have both verbs for "to be": infinitive "estar" for temporal state

If the string is "es", say yes. \ "is" is not \ isn't: "to be" conjugated in the singular third person (3ps) present, perm.
If the string is "está", say yes. \ "is" is not \ isn't: "to be" conjugated in the singular third person (3ps) present, temp.
If the string is "son", say yes. \ "are" are not \ aren't: "to be" conjugated in the plural third person (3pp) present, perm.
If the string is "están", say yes. \ "are" are not \ aren't: "to be" conjugated in the plural third person (3pp) present, temp.

If the string is "fue", say yes. \ "was" was not \ wasn't: only used in Noodle (3ps) past, perm.
If the string is "estaba", say yes. \ "was" was not \ wasn't: only used in Noodle (3ps) past, temp.
If the string is "fueron", say yes. \ "were" were not \ weren't?: not used in CAL (3pp) past, perm.
If the string is "estaban", say yes. \ "were" were not \ weren't?: not used in CAL (3pp) past, temp.

If the string is "será", say yes. \ it "will" will not \ won't: not used in CAL (3ps) past, perm.
If the string is "estará", say yes. \ it "will" will not \ won't: not used in CAL (3ps) past, temp.
If the string is "serán", say yes. \ they "will" will not \ won't: not used in CAL (3pp) past, perm.
If the string is "estarán", say yes. \ they "will" will not \ won't: not used in CAL (3pp) past, temp.

If the string is "puede", say yes. \ it "can" cannot \ can't: only case in CAL (3ps)
If the string is "pueden", say yes. \ they "can" cannot \ can't: not used in CAL (3pp) added just in case 

\these two following cases could be treated as beginning with negative particle "no"? they also are considered in decider of negative words
If the string is "no puede", say yes. \ it "cannot": only case in CAL (3ps); should we used a literal translation to simplify "puede no"? sounds a little awkward but understandable enough
If the string is "no pueden", say yes. \ they "cannot": not used in CAL (3pp) added just in case; should we used a literal translation to simplify "pueden no"? sounds a little awkward but understandable enough

\If the string is "may", say yes. \ "may" may not \ mayn't: in Spanish the same use as "could"; not used in CAL
If the string is "pudiera", say yes. \ it "could" could not \ couldn't: not used in CAL (3ps) added just in case
If the string is "pudieran", say yes. \ they "could" could not \ couldn't:  not used in CAL (3pp) added just in case
If the string is "pudiéramos", say yes. \ we "could" could not \ couldn't: only once in Noodle (1pp) "To decide if we could find a pointer:"
\"we could" i.e. "nosotros pudiéramos", note the verb conjugation

\If the string is "would", say yes. \ "would" would not \ wouldn't: in Spanish the same use as "should" I guess; not used in CAL
If the string is "debe", say yes. \ it "should" should not \ shouldn't: (3ps)
If the string is "deben", say yes. \ they "should" should not \ shouldn't: (3pp)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\If the string is "do", say yes. \ "do": not used in CAL; same case as affirmative "does"

\If the string is "sí", say yes. \ "does": only case used in CAL for affirmative questions, then we could use "sí" with accent, emphasizing literal "yes"

\example from Noodle: \ both good in Spanish,
\To     decide   if   a      string     does   end         with   another  string;
\Para  decidir  si   una  cadena   sí        termina   con   otra        cadena; \ case with emphasis on the verb "does end" - "sí termina"

\To     decide   if   a      string       ends         with    another   string;
\Para  decidir  si   una  cadena     termina    con    otra         cadena; \ usual case in Spanish without emphasis on verb "ends" - "termina"

\Exception: negative questions with "does not" where it could be a "si no" without accent, literal "if not", despite being in a sentence beginning with an "if"
\example from Noodle:
\If the substring    does  not  start  with "\\", exit.
\Si  la   subcadena  si        no   inicia  con "\\", salida. \ it sounds somewhat repetitive in Spanish (si ... si ...), but is understandable, simplifying translation
\Si  la   subcadena             no   inicia  con "\\", salida. \ this sounds natural in Spanish, this would be best

\Well... To simplify more: use "si" for "do/does" without distinguish "sí/si" and leaves the interpretation to the reader/writer
If the string is "si", say yes. \ "does": only case used in CAL for affirmative questions, used also for negative ones "does not" -> "si no" with neg. after
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the string is "tiene", say yes. \ it "has" used in type definitions; (3ps) present
If the string is "tienen", say yes. \ they "have" used in type definitions; (3pp) present

\Watch out! "has" in deciders works differently: has  -> ha, been -> sido; may be it is easy because is the only "has been" in all of CAL
\To     decide   if   the  mouse  has  been  dragged      from  a    spot                         given  a      grid:
\Para  decidir  si   el      ratón  ha    sido   arrastrado  de      un  sitio/lugar/punto   dada  una  grilla:

\Better and simple translation?:  has (like do/does) -> si, been -> fue, ...
\To decide if the mouse has been dragged from ...
\Para decidir si el ratón si fue arrastrado de ...
\If the mouse has not been dragged from ...
\Para decidir si el ratón si no fue arrastrado de ... \ rare but good enough, ... sounds better without "si"

\But... has -> ha
\To decide if the user has clicked in some choices;
\Para decidir si el usuario ha cliqueado en algunas opciones.

\Well... summary: "has/have" for deciders
\has/have been                ->  ha/han sido  (3ps/3pp)
\has/have +  past part.    ->  ha/han  (3ps/3pp)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\If the string ends with "n't", say yes.  \ "n't"
\this case is difficult because in Spanish negatives begin with negative particle "no" at least two words: the negative particle and the verb
\shouldn't: no debe
\can't: no puede
\it hasn't: no tiene
\they haven't: no tienen
\isn't: no es / no está
\aren't: no son: no son / no están
\doesn't: si no, lit. for "does not" see exception for does
\don't: si no, lit. for "do not" see exception for does
\... in all cases could be treated after as a particle "not" Sp. "no", as in English, with a little awkardness for Spanish, but understandable enough

To decide if a string is any negative word:
If the string is "no", say yes. \ "not"
If the string is "no puede", say yes. \ it "cannot" (3ps), could be lit. "puede no" rare but good enough 
If the string is "no pueden", say yes. \ they "cannot" (3pp), could be lit. "pueden no" rare but good enough 
If the string is "nada", say yes. \ "nothing"
If the string ends with "n't", say yes. \ "n't"
Say no.

The compiler looks for "negative words" in conditional statements, removes them,
and then calls a "positive" decider routine and reverses the result.
For example, when the compiler finds this statement...

"If the string is not any negative word, beep."

...it will remove the "not" and match the rest to the above routine;
then it will generate machine code to make the call, with added machine code to reverse the boolean result.

\ trouble makers
If the string is "inicia", say yes. \ "begins" does not begin \ doesn't begin: syn. "comienza"; could we add synonyms?
If the string is "comienza", say yes. \ "starts" does not start \ doesn't start: I hear a yes
If the string is "termina", say yes. \ "ends" does not end \ doesn't end
If the string is "finaliza", say yes. \ "ends" does not end \ doesn't end
If the string is "parece", say yes. \ "looks" does not look \ doesn't look
If the string is "luce", say yes. \ "looks" does not look \ doesn't look
If the string is "necesita", say yes. \ "needs" does not need \ doesn't need: not used in CAL
If the string is "requiere", say yes. \ "needs" does not need \ doesn't need: not used in CAL
Say no.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\Prepositions in Spanish are twice a handful:
\“a”, “ante”, “bajo”, “cabe”, “con”, “contra”, “de”, “desde”, “durante”, “en”, “entre”, “hacia”, “hasta”, “mediante”, “para”, “por”, “según”, “sin”, “so”, “sobre”, “tras”, “versus” y “vía”
\ prep. in the context of SAL, not on a full Spanish grammar, as you note will use plenty of equivalent phrases with adverbs instead of a single prep. word

Please replace the quoted words (like "are" and "be" and "not") in the routines above with appropriate Spanish equivalents,
where possible. I will then paste them into the SAL-1001 and he will be a little older, and know more, and work better, than the SAL-1000.

Thanks,

Gerry
