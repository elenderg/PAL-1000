Compañero Quijote:

\We're together in this endeavour.

I am with you.

\I could do some of the tests if you guide me to, it would be more natural for me walking around SAL-1004.

I will send you the SAL-1004 later today. I need to clean up some things first, and you'll need a new SAL-1003 to compile it
because there were a couple of bugs in the SAL-1003 compiler.

\I mean that every time I press the Ñ/ñ key is written on screen in S/CAL but I can't found the code in Noodle for recognizing that key on the keyboard.
\How is it working?

The keyboards (and how Windows handles them) are messy. This page will give you some idea of what we have to work with:

In the CAL, we simplified this by combining the wm_syskeydown and wm_keydown and wm_syschar and wm_char messages into one, simple "key down" event.
It works great in English with an American keyboard. Now we will make it work great in Spanish with a Latin American keyboard, God willing.
I will send a test program later today with the SAL-1004 that will show us what kind of messages we're getting from your keyboard.

\You're right indeed, when I search I could find either the big or the little only if I write the same in find.

This is fixed in the SAL-1004. We had to do it in machine code (to keep it fast). We tried using Window's functions and it made
the compiler three times slower.

\At work we have many of them, that's Latin American or Spanish variant; I have another (International) Spanish keyboard in my home laptop.

\In either one, it is needed to press the ALT GR + the key with a third symbol at the bottom right of the key to get it on screen after release.
\This method is almost universal for every keyboard for other languages or countries, besides changing physical layout for other symbols.

I'm hoping we can get this to work.

\One more question:
\La tecla limpiar es una tecla equal to 12. \ clear key = limpiar? 
\I can't find the clear key.

I don't know where the clear key is either. When we wrote the CAL, we just translated Microsoft tables like this:

I don't think it's important.

Tu compañero Quijote, Gerry.

PS: the clear key is present on MacBooks
