\ Jasper,

I wrote a "splash a color" turtle demo to figure out
some issues with measuring the differences between colors,
and with picking "a color near a color".

\ Anyway, it ran. But it looked kind of ugly because it only occupied 1/2 of my screen
\ minus about 1/2 inch at the bottom -- even though the program says "clear the screen"
\ without further qualification.

Thank you for pointing that out.
This means there are two things to improve.

The CAL-40xx tries to "make the child program the same size
as the parent program."  It does this by passing running options
to the child program, based on the command-line options
used to launch the parent program.  The CAL-4700 is full-screen,
and does not pass any running options to the child program.

The half-inch tells me that I need to do some more work on the
task-bar accommodation feature.  You said that your taskbar
is never visible, but somehow CAL-4018 thinks that it is
"about 1/2 inch at the bottom".

\ Unsolicited tip: I replaced "wait for 3 seconds" with "wait for the escape key" so I could
\ study the output more closely. I do this a lot in "quicky" programs.

\ -- Gerry

I'm glad you replaced "wait for 3 seconds" with
"wait for the escape key".  I should have done that myself,
when I extracted this mini-demo from the full turtle demo.
