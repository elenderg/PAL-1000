I have released the CAL-4017 on both GitHub,
and on the "O:\" drive.

\ Congratulations on the completion of a big job.

\ I have removed the CAL-4017 directory from the O:\ drive, however,
\ because (as you know) it is not representative of our Osmosian ways.
\ You know my objections: not full screen, wrong font, scroll bars,
\ too many files, too big (you really should delete the .lst file), etc.
\ I have a copy on my computer and I left a copy in your mailbox.

\ We pictured Plain English being extended and improved with
\ additional libraries (like 3D graphics, SQL database access, etc),
\ compatible with the CAL-4700 Noodle, documented in standard
\ fashion using the writer. That is how I should have implemented the
\ turtle graphics, and I should have titled the documentation
\ "Plain English Turtle Graphics". This way, the "look and feel" would
\ remain consistent, and the Plain English programmer could include
\ whatever extensions he needs for his particular applications.

\ Unfortunately, the product never got past the "tipping point" of
\ popularity necessary to provide enough interest and revenue for
\ us to enforce this regimen, and for us to improve the CAL (as required)
\ in fully approved ways. I regret that we have been unable to do
\ a better job at managing the thing.

\ I'm glad you're having fun with it, in any case.

\ Mike Gonta probably deserves an O'mail Mailbox, but he has
\ not requested one, so I've held off on creating one.
