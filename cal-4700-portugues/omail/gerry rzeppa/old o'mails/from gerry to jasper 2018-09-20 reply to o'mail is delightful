\ Hello again, Jasper.

This O'Mail is delightful!

\ I thought you might like it. And was hoping you would.

There is an old saying that
"every Unix program grows until it can send mail."
By that standard, Plain English has arrived.
(And possibly has reached completion.)

\ The nifty thing is that we didn't do anything but put a
\ shared directory on our server. So it works the same
\ with all versions of the CAL (including yours) and the SAL.
\ It's also nice that we can pass around EXEs and files
\ with no extension without email-server virus-protection
\ complaints.

O'Mail has exactly the same amount of security that
MIT's original hacking labs had.  (None, of course.)
Sadly, I was not around to see them, but I had the
blessing to work with some of the hackers who were
a part of that culture.

\ It's surprising how anonymity breeds dishonesty.
\ None of my real-world neighbors abuse my snail-mailbox.
\ But my email box gets plenty of abuse.

Congratulations to you and Pablo on figuring out a way
to bootstrap a full-featured version of CAL into Spanish.
(And here I thought "bootstrapping a full-featured version"
 was an oxymoron!)

\ As I mentioned, it really required a remarkably small number
\ of additions to the CAL. The Compiler grew by only 578 lines,
\ and the Noodle by only 1878.

I am sure there is a lot of work left to do,
but in some ways it is already ahead of Microsoft's
Spanish support.  When I worked with Microsoft's Cortana team
a couple years ago, they had deliberately told Cortana
to be ignorant of accent marks.  I don't know if they
have since retrofitted them.

\ We ignore accents sometimes, but not in critical cases.
\ "Si" (no accent), for example, means "if", while
\ "Sí" (with accent) means "yes".
\ Incremental find from the keyboard treats them the same, however.

\ You might want to take a look at the revised string comparison
\ routines in the SAL's noodle (El Seso).
\ By using the x86 XLAT instruction we were able to keep them fast.
\ There are four translation tables in the SAL.
\ Look in El Seso for "ascii table" to find them all.

Has Pablo figured out how to make SAL conjugate verbs?

\ Not necessary. The SAL, like the CAL, doesn't mind bad grammar.

Has he decided whether SAL is formal or informal?

\ Informal.

And will SAL be happy with Spanish typed with a Southern accent?

\ The type names and alternate routine headers in the SAL
\ are both Argentinian in flavor.
\ Different Spanish flavors can be had by adding additional
\ type redefinitions and alternative routine headers.
\ Note that most of the source in the SAL is still in English.

For example, Google thinks that the formal imperative
singular form of "eligir" is "elija".  According to 
https://www.spanishconjugation.net/imperative-command/elegir/
the informal imperative singular is "elija".
The formal imperative plural is "elijan".

\ Pablo has most of the verbs ending in "-ar".
\ I don't speak Spanish, so I have to assume he knows
\ his own native tongue.

Spanish has its own Southern accent.
It is used in Chile, Argentina, and southern Spain.
It has an informal second person plural.
"Vosotros" is the pronoun that corresponds to "Y'all".
The Mexicans I know are completely unaware of this pronoun
and its conjugation.  ("¡Vosotros elegid!" means "Y'all draw!")

\ Yes, it appears that "Spanish" is not always equal to "Spanish".
\ But most of the differences end up in the Noodle, not the Compiler.
\ The Compiler only cares about articles, prepositions, conjunctions,
\ and a handful of simple verbs (like IS, HAS, and DOES, in English).

I look forward to verifying CAL-40xx's compatibility with
CAL-4707.  Are there any gotchas I should be aware of?

\ The 4707 is the same as the 4700  except that it can sort
\ files in the Finder not only by kind, name, and extension, but by
\ creation date as well. I thought it might help with organizing
\ o'mails, but I'm afraid it's buggy and doesn't work as it should.
\ Best to stick with "sortable names" on o'mail files.

\ All the best to you and yours,

\ Gerry
