\ Congratulations on the completion of a big job.

Thank you.

\ I have removed the CAL-4017 directory from the O:\ drive, however,
\ because (as you know) it is not representative of our Osmosian ways.
\ You know my objections: not full screen, wrong font, scroll bars,
\ too many files, too big (you really should delete the .lst file), etc.
\ I have a copy on my computer and I left a copy in your mailbox.

That makes sense.  I have deleted the *.lst file.
I'll keep the latest released version in my mailbox.

\ We pictured Plain English being extended and improved with
\ additional libraries (like 3D graphics, SQL database access, etc),
\ compatible with the CAL-4700 Noodle, documented in standard
\ fashion using the writer. That is how I should have implemented the
\ turtle graphics, and I should have titled the documentation
\ "Plain English Turtle Graphics". This way, the "look and feel" would
\ remain consistent, and the Plain English programmer could include
\ whatever extensions he needs for his particular applications.

You still could use this approach for the turtle graphics.

The CAL-40xx series has this kind of modularity.
 * It uses the CAL-40xx noodle folder
   instead of the CAL-4700 noodle file.
 * The desktop folder and the turtle folder are both optional.
 * It is "documented in standard fashion using the writer."
Some of the build verification tests (BVTs)
confirm this modularity.  I have published the batch script
that performs these BVTs, but I have not published
the folders of data and code that the batch script uses.

If you want, I would be happy to post a version of
your "Plain English Turtle Graphics" documentation
and the demo scripts along with CAL-40xx.
That would let me publish the full BVTs.
Sadly, some of the BVTs are still manual.

\ Unfortunately, the product never got past the "tipping point" of
\ popularity necessary to provide enough interest and revenue for
\ us to enforce this regimen, and for us to improve the CAL (as required)
\ in fully approved ways. I regret that we have been unable to do
\ a better job at managing the thing.

\ I'm glad you're having fun with it, in any case.

\ Mike Gonta probably deserves an O'mail Mailbox, but he has
\ not requested one, so I've held off on creating one.

Do you have any other concerns about CAL-4017
that I should address before releasing CAL-4018?
CAL-4018 will include the ability to sort o'mail by date.
Of course, it will be able to sort any files and folders
by date.  CAL-4018 also accommodates the task bar better;
I find that this encourages me to use it in full screen mode
instead of half-screen mode.
