Dear Gerry,

You're so quick!
I did not finish yet the long list of prepositions.
But you already used what I've been writing along the day!

I will try the SAL-1001, and soon I will finish preps list to update it.
I will translate also manual in this days.
Tomorrow we go back to full throttle, we are already finishing long holidays for Semana Santa.

I will spread the word!

Pablo
