Dear Pablo,

I'm thinking you may need another Bible verse. A lock is only as good as the next pair of bolt-cutters.

Psalm 127:1: "A menos que el Señor proteja la ciudad, la guardia se despierta, pero en vano."

Reasonable precautions, sure. But keep in mind that the devil wants us spending
our time and energy fighting his henchmen instead of doing God's work
(ie, good, creative, positive, useful things).

Tu compañero peregrino,

Gerry

\Querido Gerry:

\Wise words, thank you for your message and your support.

\I have already running my car again.
\Now I'm wondering how to add some lock to the battery by myself, because collision repair mechanics give my a date too long in the future.

\I'm keeping my dad's car in my garage due to travel of him to Mexico to visit my two brothers, one sister and two nephews (his grandsons), he will stay some months.
\That's why mine sleep outside. And now I'm figuring out how to enter mine as well in the space of the garden or front yard. I need to put some gravel to avoid sink of wheels in the soft soil.

\Again thak you for your best whishes and caring words.

\Tu amigo sureño Pablo.
