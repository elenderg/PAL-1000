\ Hello again, Lope.

\ I'm in blue, you're in black, as usual.

You're not too blunt. I've been married 28 years; my wife's been nothing but blunt to me.

\ "Behind every great man is a woman... rolling her eyes!"

Of whatever I translate using Google Translate.

\ Pablo and I found Google Translate to be helpful, but hardly sufficient:
\ - Google would sometimes return different translations of a given sentence on different days.
\ - Most of Google's Spanish translations were not reversible: English to Spanish to English to Spanish changed the translation.
\ - Pablo would often say, of a Google translation, "That's not at all how we would say it in Argentina!"

I plan on translating CAL to Italian first. I might call it CALI. When I'm done with that, I'll go to work on the Tagalog translation. I think I'll call it KALOG.

\ You can call your version whatever you like.
\ We chose CAL-xxxx because it was like the HAL-9000 in the movie "2001 - A Space Odyssey"
\ And because CAL is an acronym for "Compiler And Linker"
\ We chose SAL for the Spanish version because Spanish starts with "S"

I grew up in the Philippines in a town that spoke Ilongo. 
Ilongo is equivalent to Hiligaynon.
Tagalog is equivalent to Filipino.
Tagalog/Filipino is the national language of the Philippines.

\ Do you think people in your home town would like to learn about programming in Ilongo?
\ Seems to me that would be a well-defined market to target with a product NOBODY else is offering.
\ And the Ilongo/English combination might even be attractive to schools there.

I came over to the USA at 21 years old and I stayed here. I'm almost 50 now so I've lived mostly in the USA. 
I came to the Virginia first but I've lived in Los Angeles, California for practically all of my living here in the US.
I speak English with everybody except for my wife (who came from the same region in the Philippines as me) with whom I converse in both English and Hiligaynon.
I have a son who speaks Italian and Spanish (as well as English, of course) for having lived abroad for a year.
I have a daughter who is learning French.
I have many friends who speak Tagalog.
I have friends who speak other foreign languages but Tagalog and Hiligaynon are the only languages I personally understand and speak well.

\ So you can translate from English to Hiligaynon and back in your head, no Google necessary.
\ And you know what sounds natural and what doesn't in each language.
\ Seems to me that might be a good place to begin.

I don't speak Tagalog perfectly because it was not the primary language of the region where I grew up; that language was Hiligaynon.
I don't speak Hiligayon perfectly because that was not the language of instruction in schools; that language was English.
I understand and speak a little Spanish.
I had two years of Spanish education.

\ What language do you think in? What pops out of your mouth when there's no time to translate in your head?
\ In an emergency, for example, do you find yourself saying, "Don't touch that! It's hot!" Or something else?

I don't mean that we add another language to the SAL. SAL is the Spanish/English hybrid and it will remain so, as far as I am concerned.

\ Okay with me.

I agree that the interface of what that guy made is hideous. 
To be honest, I've thought of some of those "improvements", too, (like having indicators for the menu letters that have functions) but there has to be a better way.

\ Our menus are more like the Index at the back of a printed book; traditional menus are more like the Table of Contents.
\ The Index is for people who know what they are looking for; the Table of Contents is for people who are browsing, who want an overview.
\ Since a program is used, most of the time, by people who already know how it works, we chose Index-style menus.

The way you were doing it with Pablo, I propose we do this translation with me and my son.

\ The problem with the way I did it with Pablo is that he didn't learn enough about how the SAL actually works.
\ Now it is hard for him to fix bugs and make changes.
\ In short, the more YOU do (and the less I do, except for teaching and advising) the better.
\ How much do you know about compilers?

Additionally: Instead of doing the translation from the original CAL, we translate the Spanish parts of SAL to Italian (assuming that that's the language we decide to do).

\ I agree, it's better to start with the SAL. The SAL has language features the CAL doesn't.
\ For example, in multi-word names, the SAL looks for the type name at both the beginning and the end of the name.

We keep the English parts; people can use English as well as Italian.
I will ask my son (who speaks Italian and Spanish) to help by improving our googled translations.

\ Does your son know enough Italian to know how native Italian speakers actually say things?

No [browser]? The sample program from the osmosian.com website is able to access the web and show a picture from it. 
that shows that programs produced from CAL has some functions of a browser.

\ Not exactly. The CAL is able to download a web page as TEXT, and that's all.
\ The CAL does not know how to interpret CSS or HTML or JavaScript, etc.

 I think CAL can do any programs we want it to make.

\ Any stand-alone Windows application, yes. You could even write a full-featured web browser in Plain English...
\ ...but it would be a VERY big job since you would have to write interpreters for CSS and HTML and JavaScript, etc, etc, etc.

What I meant by connectivity with the world is mainly that it can access the web (which it can; see above).

\ Yes, the CAL can ACCESS the web, but it doesn't know how to INTERPRET what it finds there.

Also, that it can produce documents that is (any) web browser friendly.

\ The only web-browser-friendly documents the CAL produces are PDFs.

Also, that it can run web apps on the backend with a version of CAL itself doing most if not all the "serving" ala CGI
I think this is worth pursuing. It can be executable files, and as long as we get it to run from the server it can be made from any language, even Plain English.

\ It may be worth pursuing, but frankly, I have no idea how to do that.
\ The CAL was designed as a stand-alone Windows application for producing similar stand-alone Windows applications.

Python, PHP, Perl...

\ And once again you're pointing me to folks who "don't practice what they preach."
\ If Python is a real language, why isn't Python written in Python?
\ If PHP is a real language, why isn't PHP written in PHP?
\ If Perl is a real language, why isn't Perl written in Perl?

Programmers like to do web apps. 

\ Yes, they do. Unfortunately, that is not what the CAL is and does.
\ The CAL is a stand-alone Windows application for producing similar stand-alone Windows applications.

Computers are so fast nowadays and internet speeds had been increasing that web apps mimic the speed of native apps.

\ The speed, perhaps. But not the simplicity.

If we make a web app version of CAL, or a CAL-produced executables, that run on the server and power a web app:

\ The CAL takes in English and puts out just three kinds of things:
\ (a) binary data;
\ (b) calls to Windows DLLs; and
\ (c) native Intel x86 instructions
\ in a form consistent with the Windows Portable Executable format.

\ What do you picture this "WebCAL" putting out?

The need for CAL to be ported to another operating system can be postponed.

\ Is this really a NEED?
\ 82% of desktop computers run Windows. And the CAL looks and feels the same on all of them.

\ The CAL will always have to be ported to other operating systems, because...
\ ...a CAL that isn't written entirely with itself isn't a CAL;
\ ...a CAL that doesn't produce native executables for a particular hardware/OS system isn't a CAL; and
\ ...a CAL that doesn't provide unfettered access to a machine's screen and file system isn't a CAL.

Antivirus problems will be gone, too (people can run CAL-powered web apps from their web browser).

\ Probably so. But only because the CAL wouldn't be the CAL anymore.

\ It seems clear that you're talking about a different KIND of program than the CAL, and
\ I'm having trouble imagining exactly what that looks like. So I'll ask again:

\ The CAL takes in English and puts out just three kinds of things:
\ (a) binary data;
\ (b) calls to Windows DLLs; and
\ (c) native Intel x86 instructions
\ in a form consistent with the Windows Portable Executable format.

\ What does a "CAL-powered web app" take in and put out?

To know where to chew first:
  Find out which task is easiest.
If each task is equally hard;
  If each task is equally easy:
  Take pick randomly.

\ Is that a nested IF?
\ My rule is do the hardest task first, so you don't get stuck later.

So, are you agreeing that we proceed with the translation of SAL(Spanish - English) to Italian-English? Call it CALI?
Or, do you think I should stick with Tagalog(Filipino) which is more of my native tongue? Or even Hiligaynon(Ilongo)?

\ I think it's best to go after:
\ (a) a well-defined market;
\ (b) with miminal or no competition;
\ (c) that you personally know well.

\ Though it may be better for your son if you go the Italian-English route.
\ How old is your son?

Has there been an attempt to make a web app CAL?

\ Yes. I believe I mentioned before that...
\ I did some work on a Plain English to Javascript "compiler" upon request, a few years ago,
\ but there were serious incompatibilities that were difficult to overcome.
\ Plain English, for example, passes ALL variables by reference,
\ while Javascript passes simple types by value and others by reference.
\ And such a thing would not be a "real" language, since it would lack the three features mentioned above.

\ I also tried running the CAL on a server that provided access via any Browser.
\ These are the folks who provided the server (and the additional layer of software):
\ https://datamarksystems.com/WebSolutions.htm
\ The result was buggy, sluggish, and imprecise.
\ The free demo they did for me is no longer available, but you can contact them here:
\ https://datamark.live/contact
\ and see if they'll put up a free demo for you.
\ This is undoubtedly the easiest way to "get the CAL in a browser window"...
\ ...so you can see why it's not a good idea.

Which task is more urgent (in pursuit of developing CAL and promoting it), to have it translated to another language, or;
Get a type of CAL or executable to run on a web server?

\ You've probably guessed by now that I'm not a fan of the "web server CAL", so the question is more-or-less moot.
\ Plain English is not the same KIND of thing as Python, Perl, PHP or JavaScript. It's more like Pascal or C.

\ But it's your call. I'm happy to teach you whatever you need to know about the CAL.

\ Gerry
