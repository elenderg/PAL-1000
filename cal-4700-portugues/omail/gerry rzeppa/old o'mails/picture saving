Dahd,

The code in the "picture save" directory will save a picture downloaded from the internet to c:\temp\test.png
The new function "to write a picture to a path" is in the program file.

You'll see some constants in the "to write a picture to a path" routine with different UUID's for saving as different types. We could enhance this routine to take a type
as a parameter and use the correct UUID, or whatever.

I could also write a routine that would put the picture into a buffer if you need that.

Let me know if you need anything else.
