In the serial port directory there is a sample program that will 

open a serial port
write to a serial port
read from a serial port
close the serial port

All the new routines are in the "cereal bowl" file.

I haven't been able to really test this out yet because I don't have any serial ports on my computer and I don't have any USB
adaptors or serial cables. I've ordered some stuff that will be here on Sunday so I can test a little better.

I ended up not adding a routine to see if there's anything to read. It's set up right now, where you just call read,
and if there's no bytes the buffer will be empty.

We can change this if we want.

One weird thing I noticed in "the program" is the commented write line:

  write "hello world" to the serial port.
  
When you try to compile that it says:
  
I don't know how to 'write [string] in/into/to [serial port].
  
I'm thinking something is getting goofed up with all the other writes that we have since if you add a:
  
to snoz a buffer into a serial port.
  
You can call it just fine.

I'm looking into it a bit more.
