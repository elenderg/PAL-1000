Sorry Gerry,
\Again your enthusiasm is to be commended, but we'll never get the thing translated this way.
\I can't spend all my time making "quick fixes" and "haphazard updates" to the program and the Noodle.
\We must proceed in a slow, orderly fashion, step by boring step, page by tedious page.
\Gerry

I've been trying to do the exercises from a guide for the students, and as you say the names of the variables are given: A and B.
I can't use A as such, nor "variable A" because we have not that concepts in a simple language for programming like the Plains.

I will retake the way with you.

Sorry, again.

Pablo
