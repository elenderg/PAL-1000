\ Jasper,

I have released the CAL-4018 in "O:\jasper paulsen\cal-4018\",
and on GitHub, in "https://github.com/Folds/english".

\ Congratulations. Unfortunately, "audience response" on github
\ appears to be as lacking as everywhere else.
\ I think you'd get better response with a command-line, interface-free
\ version for Linux.

As usual, "O:\jasper paulsen\cal-4018\" is set up so that
the program can be compiled using any CAL-40xx or CAL-4700.

\ Nice feature.

CAL-4018 has some modest changes:

 * The turtle can now
   "fade a line a length long from a color to another color".

\ Interesting feature. Did you need this to produce a particular drawing?

 * The finder can now be refreshed, and sort by date.
   It can also sort, reverse, and refresh the root node.

\ Okay.

 * The window shape now accommodates the taskbar shape
   as of when the program started up.  In the switch,
   the active tab is filleted.

\ No comment. ("If you can't say something nice...")

If you have any potential users who are interested in
Plain English Programming, but are intimidated by
CAL-4700's user interface, CAL-4018 might be a good match
for them.

\ I have never met anyone who is intimidated by the CAL-4700's interface.
\ A lot of people don't like it (at first) but it's not because they're intimidated.
\ It's just not what they're used to. I find that once people get used to it,
\ (including the use of ALT-TAB), they like it.
