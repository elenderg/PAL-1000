Hello, Elender!

Welcome to O'mail (Osmosian Mail).

You can communicate with other Osmosians here. Just use the CAL to make a text file on
your computer (don't work directly in this directory), then copy your file and paste it into the
recipient's "mailbox." You can also send and receive CAL-created documents and Plain English
program directories in this way.

Note the naming convention for message file names:

\ from gerry to walter 2019-06-24 welcome to o'mail

Note also that you can "color up" a line by making it a "comment", as above.

I don't check my O'mail box every day, and neither does anyone else. See the second page of the
document in your mailbox for more about how we really use this.

Note that you're "on your honor here". There are no passwords or other protections.

Gerry
