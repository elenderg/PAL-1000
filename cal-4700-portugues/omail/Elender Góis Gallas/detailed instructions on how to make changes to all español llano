Here you go!

\ MAKE A NEW VERSION OF THE PROGRAM AND DOCUMENTATION

1. Start up the SAL-1015.

2. Make sure the instrucciones in the SAL-1015 documentación directory are the most recent version
    that you want carried forward.

3. Duplicate the SAL-1015 directory; call the duplicated directory SAL-1016.

4. Open the SAL-1016 directory on the far left tab.

5. Select and delete the SAL-1015.exe file from the SAL-1016 directory.

6. Select the six "code" files in the SAL-1016 directory, and press ENTER.

7. Change the comment at the top of each file: SAL-1015 -> SAL-1016.

\ FIX THE COMPILER

8. Find "primea" (I know that is misspelled) in El Compilador, which will take you to the spot where El Compilador
    adds adds "primero" and "primera" fields to any record type defined as una cosa.
    This is the line of code that is wrong (I misspelled "primera"):

    Add a third feminine spanish field to the chain type's fields given "primea " then the type's name and "primea" and the type's name and the on flag.

9. Change "primea" -> "primera" in two places in the line above.
     IMPORTANT! Note that the first instance is followed by one space, but the second is not.

\ FIX EL SESO

10. Now switch tabs and find "primero" in El Seso, which will take you here:

A rider has \ fix "bump a rider" and "unbump a rider" if you change me
an original substring, una subcadena primero at the original substring,
a source substring, una subcadena fuente at the source substring and
a token substring, una subcadena componente at the token substring.

11. Change the second line of the above record to look like this:

A rider has \ fix "bump a rider" and "unbump a rider" if you change me
an original substring, una subcadena primera at the original substring, \ primero -> primera
a source substring, una subcadena fuente at the source substring and
a token substring, una subcadena componente at the token substring.

12. Then find "primero" again (CTRL-N or CTRL-S), which will take you here:

A string has a first byte pointer and a last byte pointer
and un primero puntero octeto at the first byte pointer and
un último puntero octeto at the last byte pointer.

13. Change the above record to looke like this:

A string has a first byte pointer and a last byte pointer
and un primero puntero octeto at the first byte pointer and
and un primera puntero octeto at the first byte pointer and \ new line, same as above except primero -> primera
un último puntero octeto at the last byte pointer and
un última puntero octeto at the last byte pointer. \ new line, similar to above except último -> última

Make sure you have the "and" and the "." in the right place on the last two lines.

\ TEST THE ABOVE CHANGES

14. Run the program (CTRL-R or CTRL-E). This will save all your changes.

15. Use the Versión command to make sure you are in the SAL-1016.

16. Find and duplicate the SAL-1016 directory; call the new directory SAL-1016 BABY.

17. Still working in the 1016, open the SAL-1016 BABY directory on the leftmost tab.
       Delete the SAL-1016.exe file, then
       Select the six "code" files and press ENTER.

18. Run the program (CTRL-R or CTRL-E). Use the Version command to make sure you're in the SAL-1016 BABY.
      Now we know that we can still re-compile ourself. This is good.

19. Quit the SAL-1016 BABY and use the Version command to make sure you are back in the SQL-1016.

\ MAKE A NEW, REVISED VERSION OF THE SAL MONET

20. Close all the SAL-1016 BABY files, then
       Find your SAL MONET 1015 directory and duplicate it; call the new directory SAL MONET 1016.

21. Open the SAL MONET 1016 directory. Delete the SAL MONET 1015.exe file and the El Seso file.
      Then copy the revised El Seso file from the SAL-1016 directory and paste it into the SAL MONET 1016 directory.

22. Open the SAL MONET 1016 "cómo pintar" file, find all the "primero" names and change the ones you don't like to "primera".

23. Run the SAL MONET 1016 and paint some pictures to make sure it still works.

24. Quit the SAL MONET 1016.

\ UPDATE THE SAL-1016 DOCUMENTATION

25. Working in the SAL-1016, close the "cómo pintar" file, then
       find and open the Instructions in the Documentation directory.
       Open the first page, and use the find command to find and change 1015 -> 1016 in many places.
       The easiest way is to find the first instance of 1015, change it to 1016, then double-click the 1016 and copy it;
       Now all you have to do is find next (CTRL-S), paste (CTRL-V), again and again.

26. Return to the first page, and use the find command to find and fix all instances of "primero".

27. Return to the first page, and use the find command to find and fix all instances of "ultimo".

28. Save your instructions file.

\ UPDATE YOUR FELLOW QUIXOTE

29. Delete the SAL-1016 BABY; it is not needed any more.

30. Paste a copy of your SAL-1016 and SAL MONET 1016 directories into my O'Mail mailbox
      so I will be up to date.

May God guide your fingers!
