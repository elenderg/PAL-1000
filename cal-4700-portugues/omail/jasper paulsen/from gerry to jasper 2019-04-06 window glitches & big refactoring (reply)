\ Jasper,

\ Our Osmosian Plain English system is meant to inspire and
\ enlighten those who study it. It is intentionally iconoclastic -
\ Designed to specifically challenge pretty much each and every
\ preconceived notion that today's professional programmer
\ might have - and that (God forbid!) a beginner might be tempted
\ to adopt.

\ The example and proof we offer is our simple, digestable, and
\ very efficient development system, which includes a unique interface,
\ a simplified file manager, a handy hexadecimal dumper, an elegant editor
\ a native-code-generating compiler/linker, and a wysiwyg page-layout
\ facility for documentation and other creative writing tasks.
\ Our shared directory allows us to communicate with each other, over
\ the Internet, without POP3 and IMAP and other email complexities.

\ In other words, we want - as much as possible - to show our
\ fellows what a "better world" looks like. We want them to experience,
\ first hand, Plain English Land, where things are consistently simple
\ and beautiful. Hence, our full-screen interface that hides all the
\ ugly stuff behind and beneath it.

This means there are two things [screen size and task bar] to improve.

\ I agree. You can fix both those problems by making all Plain English programs
\ full-screen, with the task bar hidden (the user can minimize or use the
\ Windows key to see the task bar, if necessary).

\ You can also easily fix your refactoring problem by putting everything but the 
\ Turtle back into the Noodle.

\ SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

\ I think your enthusiasm for Plain English is laudatory. But it seems to me that
\ all you have done is deface the image we want to present to others by
\ dragging common interface widgets and Linux techniques into  a system
\ that was designed, specifically, to eliminate those things.

\ As far as I can tell, your deviations from Osmosian principles have not attracted
\ any new sheep to the fold. So that's not why Plain English is unpopular.

\ But your changes have resulted in unintended consequences, as exemplified by our
\ latest experiment (me trying to run your color program). So...

\ Option 1:

\ You stop mangling the Osmosian Image and develop a command-line, interface-free
\ version of Plain English specifically designed to attract Linux aficionados. I'll help
\ you as much as I can.

\ Option 2:

\ You join us, in spirit, and help us improve the system with the development of
\ additional libraries compatible with the CAL-4700. I'll pull the Turtle out of our
\ Noodle (and document it) as a start. We can talk about which libraries might be
\ useful for you to work on, and what changes to the CAL might be warranted
\ (for example, forcing a 4:3 screen ratio - with black bars on the side, if necessary -
\ would make the interface more consistent and more beautiful on all machines. 
\ I don't know, for instance, how long I can make these lines of text because I don't
\ know what your screen width is, or what font you are using in the Editor. That is
\ an abomination contrary to Osmosian principles. The programmer/author is supposed
\ to know what his work is going to look like to his user, and it is our job to make that as
\ likely - as wysiwyug (what-you-see-is-what your-USER-gets) - as possible. That, by
\ the way, is main reason why the Osmosian font is built-in, and why you shouldn't be
\ changing it at your end.)

\ Option 3:

\ Something else; feel free to make suggestions.

\ But please, let's stop working at odds with one another. It is not helping either of us.
