happy new year!!

that CP/M system looks interesting. i've been looking at freebsd as another operating system i've
heard a lot about but never used. it seems interesting, though it's similar to linux in that it doesn't
always have graphical display and mouse support (it's used in a lot of routers and servers, which run
headless).

however, its executable format is the a.out format (which is much simpler than the elf spec). more
and more research...

i hope the holiday season has treated you well! 

peace,
mo
