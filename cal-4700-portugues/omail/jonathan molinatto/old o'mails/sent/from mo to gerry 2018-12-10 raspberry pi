so i've been reading through some build-an-operating-system tutorials for the raspberry pi, and it
appears that using a raspberry pi might be a decent way to get started. it uses an arm chip, which is
a register-based cpu, and can be big endian (i think it's configurable, which seems weird). i have no
idea what endianness it actually implemented on the boards. if raspberry pi won't work, i've read
other blogs of people using arm chips to build custom computers. so that's also a possibility. arm
chips are cheap and fast.

the biggest downside is the amount of ram on a pi board. typically 512M or 1G. if we're designing
the system from scratch, will we need 4G ram? most of the more-ram requirements are from software
and kernel bloat, which goes against the osmosian order. i think 4G is a nice, round number to shoot
for, but i don't know that it's required. the bloated linux kernel and desktop os on the raspberry pi
only has 512M or 1G to work with, but it isn't laggy at all. and it is multithreaded and multi-process.
or do you want 4G as something CAL would never outgrow?

i'm getting my wife a new dell laptop, so i'll get her old lenovo laptop. so soon i'll have a dedicated
windows laptop. 

\ Hopefully, someday, you'll be running the KAL on a bare KAL machine, and will have a great user experience.

fingers crossed!

peace,
