       "so i hesitate to say there isn't a standard version of linux that includes mouse and graphics support. i believe all the desktop variants have that support built-in, but the packages/libraries used differ. it's just a completely different model from the windows side. ""linux"" is actually just the kernel that is shared among all the different distribution flavors. each distribution then packages up some subset of utilities and displays (generally no display, or ""headless"", for server-based installations). i've been doing some investigating, and i think i'll be able to find something that works for almost all desktop variants. or we could just require some specific things to be installed. i know you don't want an installer; this would be some set of minimal requirements for getting CAL to work (like it has to have a display manager)."

       "there are variants that are text-only, but even these can be ""upgraded"" to having a display with mouse and graphics support. it's all very ad-hoc. but most linux-y types have some sort of display manager running, with included mouse support. and i think i'll be able to find a ""sweet spot"" of utilities/libraries to interface with. but it'll be a lot of work. #HoldMyBeer"

       "i think i'll have to start with option (2) for just the basic bootstrap. i'll need to get something minimal working on linux that will let me iterate quickly. since i'll have so much tinkering to do in ""the noodle"" to get graphics support, i'd like to be able to make changes, compile, run, without having to move things back and forth in a local share drive. i do NOT want to write/license/support a derivative work. i want CAL on linux. period. i will spend as much time as i need to accomplish that.

       "also, by Mach-O/macos i meant apple/macintosh/steve jobs/steve wozniak. it graphic support is another beast entirely."

       "Glad you like it. I'm answering in other text blocks (on top of yours) so I can color the text blue (using the Pen command). We call this ""middle class text"" because it's not quite ""rich text"" - only one font, size, and color per text block."

       "Is it true, then, that there is no standard version of Linux that includes support for the mouse and basic graphics (like drawing rectangles) and text (with different fonts)? If so, then yes, it is probably better for Linux users to just run the CAL on top of WINE. If by ""macos"" you mean the Mach operating system, we'll probably have the same problem. Is there a standard version of Mach that includes support for the mouse and basic graphics (like drawing rectangles) and text (with different fonts)? "

       "Actually, we've written CGI server-side programs with the CAL. You just say ""Start up the CGI"" and ""Shut down the CGI"" instead of ""Start up"" and ""Shut down"" in the Run routine, and go from there. I don't know much about Linux, but it sounds like it's a text-only operating system, intended for use without a mouse. Is this true?"
