Welcome, Mo!

This is a text file I created with the CAL on my computer.
To "send" it to you, I just copied it and pasted it into your O'Mail "mailbox."

1. Note the naming convention for messages:

\ from ___ to ___ YYYY-MM-DD [optional subject]

This naming convention helps us to keep old o'mails sorted.
I made the line above blue by making it a "comment".
(The CAL thinks this is a program file since there's no extension like ".txt" on the name.)

2. Try to keep your mailbox empty by copying new posts to your own computer
or the "old o'mails" directory inside your mailbox.

3. Please don't share this address with anyone else, and
Don't do anything you wouldn't do to somebody else's snail-mail box out by the street.
We're all on the "honor system" here; no security, no passwords.
