\ Yo, Mo!

\ Good to hear from you again.

so i found the actual "hello world" program on the blog. i typed it all up in a directory with the
noodle, but it won't compile. i wanted to try to pull in the pieces i needed, but i was sufficiently
chastised from your last email, so i decided to ask a question instead.

\ The programs on the blog are generally not complete. They show the "top level" code only,
\ which in most cases was compiled with customized noodles to make the top level read more naturally.
\ But as the great and might Oz says, "Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!"

so the noodle doesn't seem to know how to "Start in the center of the screen." i will happily 
search through the other files to figure out what i'm supposed to be doing, but i'd like to try
to keep it Osmosian.

\ This is the routine you're missing:

To start in the center of the screen:
Start in the center of the screen's box.

\ You can stick it in your program file, your Noodle file, or in a new file called something like,
\ "Things that would be in the Noodle if we knew better what we were doing."

\ You're going to have to change the fancy double-quotes around "HELLO WORLD" to regular ones, too.
\ It seems WordPress changed them when I pasted the code into the blog.
\ And here I was, thinking that "paste" meant "paste", not "paste with unwanted modifications"! Silly me.

\ I'll reply to your other post later tonight.

\Gerry
