Yo Mo!

I finished my little calculator program; it's in your mailbox.
Press ESC to quit it.

The important thing to note is this: my calculator program was, conveniently and efficiently...

1. DESIGNED (wysiwyg fashion, in exact 1:1 scale); then
2. CODED (in Plain English - entered, edited, etc); then
3. COMPILED (directly to a stand-alone executable); then
4. TESTED, and
5. DEBUGGED; then
6. DOCUMENTED (wysiwyg fashion, with text and graphics); and finally
7. DELIVERED to you (via the InterWeb)

...using just a single, spartanly simple and surprisingly small, 831,488-byte program:

\ THE CAL \

Using the same program (and nothing else) I can also:

8. See what the compiler was thinking with the LIST command; and
9. See what the executable looks like with the OPEN AS DUMP command; and
10.  Convert the documentation to a PDF.

I don't think there's any other equally small and simple program on earth that can do all that.

THAT is what makes the CAL unique among development systems, and it is the
practical application of Osmosian principles and practices that produces programs like the CAL.
