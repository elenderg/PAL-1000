To reassign a pointer given a byte count:
If the pointer is nil, assign the pointer given the byte count; exit.
If the byte count is 0, unassign the pointer; exit.
Privatize the byte count.
Round the byte count up to the nearest power of two.
Call "kernel32.dll" "HeapReAlloc" with the heap pointer and 8 [heap_zero_memory] and the pointer and the byte count returning the pointer.
