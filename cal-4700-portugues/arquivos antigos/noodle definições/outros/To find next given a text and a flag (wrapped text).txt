To find next given a text and a flag (wrapped text):
Clear the flag.
If the text is nil, exit.
Convert the find anchor to an absolute position called offset given the text.
Extract a string from the text (no linefeed additions).
Put the string's first plus the offset minus 1 into a substring's first.
Put the substring's first plus the find string's length minus 1 into the substring's last.
Loop.
If the substring's last is greater than the string's last, exit.
If the substring is the find string, break.
Move the substring given 1.
Repeat.
Set the flag.
Put the substring's first minus the string's first plus 1 into an anchor absolute position.
Put the substring's last minus the string's first plus 2 into a caret absolute position.
Convert the anchor absolute position to the text's anchor given the text.
Convert the caret absolute position to the text's caret given the text.
