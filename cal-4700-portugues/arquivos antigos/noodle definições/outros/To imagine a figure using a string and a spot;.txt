To make a figure using a string and a spot;
To create a figure using a string and a center spot:
Create the figure.
Append the figure to the figures.
Privatize the string.
Lowercase the string.
Slap a substring on the string.
Loop.
Skip any leading noise in the substring.
If the substring's length is less than 2, exit.
Put the substring's first's target into a byte.
Put the byte minus the little-a byte into a spot's y.
Add 1 to the substring's first.
Put the substring's first's target into the byte.
Put the byte minus the little-a byte into the spot's x.
Multiply the spot by 1/4 inch.
Add the center spot's x minus 3-1/8 inches plus 1 pixel to the spot's x.
Add the center spot's y minus 3-1/8 inches plus 1 pixel to the spot's y.
Append the spot to the figure.
Add 1 to the substring's first.
Repeat.
