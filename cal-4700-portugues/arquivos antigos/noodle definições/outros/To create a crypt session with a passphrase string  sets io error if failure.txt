To create a crypt session with a passphrase string: \ sets i/o error if failure
Clear the i/o error.
Allocate memory for the crypt session.
\ acquire context
Call "advapi32.dll" "CryptAcquireContextA" with the crypt session's hcryptprov's whereabouts and 0 and "Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0"'s first
And 1 [prov_rsa_full] and -268435456 [crypt_verifycontext] returning a result number.
If the result is 0, put "Could not acquire context." into the i/o error; destroy the crypt session; exit.
\ create hash
Call "advapi32.dll" "CryptCreateHash" with the crypt session's hcryptprov and 32771 [calg_md5] and 0 and 0
And the crypt session's hcrypthash's whereabouts returning the result number.
If the result is 0, put "Could not create hash." into the i/o error; destroy the crypt session; exit.
\ hash passphrase
Call "advapi32.dll" "CryptHashData" with the crypt session's hcrypthash and the passphrase's first and the passphrase's length and 0 returning the result number.
If the result is 0, put "Could not hash password." into the i/o error; destroy the crypt session; exit.
\ derive session key
Call "advapi32.dll" "CryptDeriveKey" with the crypt session's hcryptprov and 26625 [calg_rc4 stream cipher] and the crypt session's hcrypthash
And 8388608 [128 bit] and the crypt session's hcryptkey's whereabouts returning the result number.
If the result is 0, put "Could not derive session key." into the i/o error; destroy the crypt session; exit.
