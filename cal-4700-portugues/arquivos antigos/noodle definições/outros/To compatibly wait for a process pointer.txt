To compatibly wait for a process pointer:
Call "kernel32.dll" "WaitForSingleObject" with the process pointer's target and -1 [infinite].
Call "kernel32.dll" "CloseHandle" with the process pointer's target.
Put 0 into the process pointer's target.
Call "user32.dll" "GetForegroundWindow" returning a window.
If the window is the main window, put 0 into eax; exit.
Call "user32.dll" "ShowWindow" with the main window and 6 [sw_minimize].
Call "user32.dll" "ShowWindow" with the main window and 9 [sw_restore].
Put 0 into eax. \ set return value of thread
