To decide if a string is in another string:
Slap a substring on the other string.
Put the substring's first plus the string's length minus 1 into the substring's last.
Loop.
If the substring's last is greater than the other string's last, say no.
If the substring is the string, say yes.
Move the substring given 1.
Repeat.
