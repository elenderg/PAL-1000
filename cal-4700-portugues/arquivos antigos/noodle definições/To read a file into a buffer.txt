To read a file into a buffer:
Clear the i/o error.
Call "kernel32.dll" "GetFileSize" with the file and nil returning a size.
Reassign the buffer's first given the size.
Put the buffer's first plus the size minus 1 into the buffer's last.
Call "kernel32.dll" "ReadFile" with the file and the buffer's first and the size and a number's whereabouts and 0 returning a result number.
If the result number is 0, put "Error reading file." into the i/o error; exit.
