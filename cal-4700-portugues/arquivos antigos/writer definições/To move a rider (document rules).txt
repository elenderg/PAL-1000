Skip any leading noise in the rider's source.
Position the rider's token on the rider's source.
If the rider's source is blank, exit.
If the rider's source's first's target is the double-quote byte, move the rider (quoted string rules); exit.
Loop.
If the rider's source is blank, exit.
If the rider's source's first's target is noise, exit.
Add 1 to the rider's token's last.
Add 1 to the rider's source's first.
Repeat.
