To handle check spelling given a source:
Load the lexicon.
If the lexicon is nil, show error "I can't find any lecksicon."; exit.
Put "check spelling" into the find mode.
Clear the source's text's last operation.
Put 1 into the find anchor.
Find the next misspelling in the source's text given a flag.
If the flag is not set, cluck; show the desktop with "Done"; exit.
Scroll the source's text to the caret and center it.
Show the desktop with "Found".
