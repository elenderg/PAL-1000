To scrub a block for extracting:
If the block is nil, exit.
Put the block's last row into a row.
If the row is nil, break.
If the row is blank, remove the row from the block's rows; destroy the row; repeat.
If the row's string starts with "\", remove the row from the block's rows; destroy the row; repeat.
