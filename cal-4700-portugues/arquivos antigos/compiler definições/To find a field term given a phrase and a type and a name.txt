To find a field term given a phrase and a type and a name:
Clear the field term.
Find the field term given the type and the name.
If the field term's field is not nil, exit.
If the phrase is not blank, find a routine given "put" and the phrase and "'s " then the name and "into".
If the routine is not nil, put the routine into the field term's function; exit.
If the type is nil, exit.
Find the routine given "put" and the type and "'s " then the name and "into".
If the routine is not nil, set the field term's push flag; put the routine into the field term's function; exit.
\  code below for looking deep within pointers - a debatable feature
\  if the type's target type is not nil, find the routine given "put" and the type's target type and "'s " then the name and "into".
\  if the routine is not nil, set the field term's dereference flag; put the routine into the field term's function; exit.
