To compile a term given a rider (runtime ratio):
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the term's variable is nil, abort with "Invalid use of /, I don't understand the variable '" then the term's phrase then "'." and the rider; exit.
Move the rider (compiler rules).
Compile another term given the rider.
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the other term's variable is nil, abort with "Invalid use of /, I don't understand the variable '" then the other term's phrase then "'." and the rider; exit.
Add an intermediate given "ratio" and the rider's token's first.
Add several fragments given "put" and the term's variable and "and" and the other term's variable and "into" and the intermediate and the rider's token's first.
Put the intermediate into the term's variable.
Clear the term's phrase.
