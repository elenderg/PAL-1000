To resolve a variable:
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the variable is nil, exit.
If the variable's type is not nil, exit.
If the variable's type name is not blank, resolve the variable (explicit type name); exit.
Find the variable's type and the variable's nickname given the variable's name.
If the variable's type is not nil, put the variable's type's name into the variable's type name; exit.
Abort with "I can't find the '" then the variable's name then "' type." and the variable's locus.
