To move a rider returning an error string (code rules - validate qualifier):
If the rider's token's length is less than 2, put "Qualifiers need to end with ')'." into the error string; exit.
If the rider's token's last's target is not the right-paren byte, put "Qualifiers need to end with ')'." into the error string; exit.
