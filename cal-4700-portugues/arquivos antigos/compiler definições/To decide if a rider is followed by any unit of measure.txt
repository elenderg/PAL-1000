To decide if a rider is followed by any unit of measure:
Privatize the rider.
Move the rider (compiler rules).
If the rider's token is not any name starter, say no.
Scan a name given the rider.
Find a type given the name and the type index.
If the type is nil, say no.
If the name is not "times", say yes. \ special because times is an infix operator and a unit of measure
If the rider's token is the start of any expression, say no.
Say yes.
