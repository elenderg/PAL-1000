To scan a global given a rider (literal term):
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Scan the global's global body given the rider.
If the rider's token is not the period byte, abort with "All global definitions must end with a period. Including this one." and the rider; exit. 
Move the rider (compiler rules).
Index the global.
