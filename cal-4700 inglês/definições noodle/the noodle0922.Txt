To duplicate a path to another path in the file system (directory):
If the path is in the other path, put "Error duplicating directory '" then the path then "' - invalid recursion." into the i/o error; exit.
If the path is not in the file system, put "Error duplicating directory '" then the path then "'." into the i/o error; exit.
If the other path is not in the file system, create the other path in the file system.
Loop.
Get an item from the path.
If the item is not found, exit.
Put the path into a third path.
Append the item's designator to the third path.
Put the other path into a fourth path.
Append the item's designator to the fourth path.
Duplicate the third path to the fourth path in the file system.
Repeat.
