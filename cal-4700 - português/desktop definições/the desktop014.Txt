To adjust a menu given a spot and a width:
If the menu is nil, exit.
Privatize the spot.
Put the spot's x plus the width into a right coord.
Loop.
Get a command from the menu's commands.
If the command is nil, break.
If the spot's x plus the command's width is greater than the right, put the original spot's x into the spot's x; add the command height to the spot's y.
Put the spot and the spot into the command's roundy box.
Add the command's width and the command height to the command's roundy box's right-bottom.
