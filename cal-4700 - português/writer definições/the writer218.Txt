To get the status for a document:
If the document is nil, clear the status' string; exit.
Put the document's selected page count into a count.
If the count is 0, format the document's pages' count and "page" or "pages" into the status' string.
If the count is not 0, format the count and "page selected" or "pages selected" into the status' string.
If the document's read-only flag is set, append " (r)" to the status' string.
