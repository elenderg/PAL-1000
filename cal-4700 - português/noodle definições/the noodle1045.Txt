To get some addrinfo routines:
Clear the i/o error.
Call "kernel32.dll" "LoadLibraryA" with "ws2_32.dll"'s first returning a handle.
If the handle is 0, put "Could not load ws2_32.dll" into the i/o error; exit.
Call "kernel32.dll" "GetProcAddress" with the handle and "getaddrinfo"'s first returning a pointer.
If the pointer is nil, put "Sorry these routines only work on Windows XP and up." into the i/o error; exit.
Put the pointer into the addrinfo routines' getaddrinfo pointer.
Call "kernel32.dll" "GetProcAddress" with the handle and "freeaddrinfo"'s first returning the pointer.
If the pointer is nil, put "Sorry these routines only work on Windows XP and up." into the i/o error; exit.
Put the pointer into the addrinfo routines' freeaddrinfo pointer.
