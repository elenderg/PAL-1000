To draw a polygon with a color (border only):
If the polygon is nil, exit.
If the color is clear, exit.
Create the hpen of the current canvas given the color.
Get a vertex from the polygon's vertices.
If the vertex is nil, exit.
Call "gdi32.dll" "MoveToEx" with the current canvas and the vertex's x and the vertex's y and nil.
Loop.
Get the vertex from the polygon's vertices.
If the vertex is nil, break.
Call "gdi32.dll" "LineTo" with the current canvas and the vertex's x and the vertex's y.
Repeat.
Destroy the hpen of the current canvas.
If the polygon's vertices' first's spot is the polygon's vertices' last's spot, exit.
Convert the color to a colorref.
Call "gdi32.dll" "SetPixelV" with the current canvas and the polygon's vertices' last's x and the polygon's vertices' last's y and the colorref.
