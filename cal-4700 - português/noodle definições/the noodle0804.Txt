To draw a gpbitmap at a spot (pdf style):
If the gpbitmap is nil, exit.
\ add xobject
Add an xobject pdf object given "image object".
Put "I" then the xobject's number into a name.
\  add to image resources in current page
Put "/" then the name then " " then the xobject's number then " 0 R" into a string.
Create a new string thing given the string.
Append the new string thing to the pdf state's current page's image strings.
\ finish setting up xobject
Append the xobject's number then " 0 obj" to the xobject.
Append "<<" to the xobject.
Append "/Type /XObject" to the xobject.
Append "/Subtype /Image" to the xobject.
Append "/ColorSpace /DeviceRGB" to the xobject.
Append "/Width " then the gpbitmap's width to the xobject.
Append "/Height " then the gpbitmap's height to the xobject.
Append "/BitsPerComponent 8" to the xobject.
Convert the gpbitmap to a buffer (pdf style).
Convert the buffer to a nibble string.
Append "/Filter /ASCIIHexDecode" to the xobject.
Append "/Length " then the nibble string's length to the xobject.
Append ">>" to the xobject.
Append "stream" to the xobject.
Append the nibble string to the xobject.
Append "endstream" to the xobject.
Append "endobj" to the xobject.
\ draw the image in the current contents
Put the gpbitmap's width times the tpp into a width.
Put the gpbitmap's height times the tpp into a height.
Put the spot's x into an x number.
Put the pdf state's current height minus the spot's y minus the height into a y number.
Output "q".
Output the width then " 0 0 " then the height then " " then the x then " " then the y then " cm".
Output "/" then the name then " Do".
Output "Q".
