To extract an extension from a path:
Clear the extension.
If the path is blank, exit.
Slap a substring on the last byte of the path.
Loop.
If the substring's first is less than the path's first, exit.
If the substring's first's target is the colon byte, exit.
If the substring's first's target is the backslash byte, exit.
If the substring's first's target is the period byte, break.
Subtract 1 from the substring's first.
Repeat.
Put the substring into the extension.
