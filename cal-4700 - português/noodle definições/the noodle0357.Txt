To create an hrgn given a polygon:
If the polygon is nil, put 0 into the hrgn; exit.
Create a vertex array given the polygon's vertices.
Call "gdi32.dll" "LPtoDP" with the current canvas and the vertex array's spot pointer and the vertex array's count.
Call "gdi32.dll" "CreatePolygonRgn" with the vertex array's spot pointer and the vertex array's count and 2 [winding] returning the hrgn.
Destroy the vertex array.
