To get a gcd given a number and another number:
Put the number into a dividend number.
Put the other number into the gcd.
De-sign the dividend number.
De-sign the gcd.
If the dividend is less than the gcd, swap the dividend with the gcd.
If the gcd is 0, put 1 into the gcd; exit.
Loop.
Divide the dividend by the gcd giving a quotient and a remainder.
If the remainder is 0, exit.
Put the gcd into the dividend.
Put the remainder into the gcd.
Repeat.
