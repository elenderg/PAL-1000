To extract a string from a text (selected bytes):
Clear the string.
If the text is nil, exit.
Loop.
Get a row from the text's rows.
If the row is nil, exit.
Slap a substring on any selected bytes in the row of the text.
If the substring is blank, repeat.
Append the substring to the string.
If the substring's last's target is the return byte, append the linefeed byte to the string.
Repeat.
