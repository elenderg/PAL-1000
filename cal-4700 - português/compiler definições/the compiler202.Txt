To compile a term given a rider (dereference):
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the term's variable is nil, abort with "Invalid dereference, I don't understand the variable '" then the term's phrase then "'." and the rider; exit.
If the term's type's target type is nil, abort with "I'm unable to determine the type of this target." and the rider; exit.
If the term's kind is "scratch", compile the term given the rider (dereference - in place); exit.
Add a scratch given the term's type's target type's name and the rider's token's first.
Add a fragment given the load address tag and the term's variable and the scratch.
Add another fragment given the dereference tag and the scratch.
Put the scratch into the term's variable.
Clear the term's phrase.
