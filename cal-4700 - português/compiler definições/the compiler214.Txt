To compile a term given a rider and a field term:
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the field term's dereference flag is set, compile the term given the rider (dereference).  
If the field term's function is not nil, compile the term given the rider and the field term (function); exit.
If the term's kind is "scratch", compile the term given the rider and the field term (in place); exit.
Put the field term's field into a field.
Add a scratch given the field's type's name and the rider's token's first.
Add a fragment given the load address tag and the term's variable and the scratch.
If the field's offset is not 0, add a third fragment given the increment tag and the scratch and the field's offset.
Put the scratch into the term's variable.
Clear the term's phrase.
