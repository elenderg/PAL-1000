To transmogrify a fragment (push value):
Attach address loading code to the fragment's code given the fragment's variable. \ put address into edx
If the fragment's variable is nil, abort with "Internal error - transmogrify a fragment (push value)"; exit.
If the fragment's variable's type is nil, abort with "Internal error 2 - transmogrify a fragment (push value)"; exit.
Put the fragment's variable's type's length into a length.
If the length is 4, attach $FF32 to the fragment's code; exit. \ push [edx]
If the length is 2, attach $66FF32 to the fragment's code; exit. \ push word ptr [edx]
If the length is 1, attach $0FB61252 to the fragment's code; exit. \ movzxb edx,[edx]; push edx
Abort with "Internal error 3 - transmogrify a fragment (push value)".
