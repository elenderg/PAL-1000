If the routine's parameters' count is 0, exit.
Copy the routine's monikettes into some monikettes.
Reduce the monikettes for utility use.
Convert the monikettes to a moniker.
Destroy the monikettes.
If the moniker is in the routine index, exit.
Find a refer given the moniker and the utility index.
If the refer is not nil, put nil into the refer's pointer; exit.
