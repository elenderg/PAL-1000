To add the destroy routine for a type (pointer):
If the type is nil, exit.
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Put "destroy [" then the type's name then "]" into a moniker.
If the moniker is in the routine index, exit.
Add a routine to the routines given nil.
Append "destroy a " then the type's name to the routine's header string.
Append "if the " then the type's name then " is nil, exit. " to the routine's body string.
If the type's target type can be reduced to "pointer", append "destroy the " then the type's name then "'s target. " to the routine's body string.
If the type's target type can be reduced to "things", append "destroy the " then the type's name then "'s target. " to the routine's body string.
Loop.
Get a field from the type's target type's fields.
If the field is nil, break.
If the field's reference flag is set, repeat.
If the field's type should not be forgotten, repeat.
Append "destroy the " then the type's name then "'s " then the field's name then ". " to the routine's body string.
Repeat.
Append "deallocate the " then the type's name then ". " to the routine's body string.
Slap the routine's routine header on the routine's header string.
Slap the routine's routine body on the routine's body string.
Compile the header of the routine.
