To scan a field given a rider (type part - byte array):
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Convert the rider's token to a ratio.
Reduce the ratio.
If the ratio's denominator is not 1, abort with "You have to specify a whole number of bytes for a byte array" and the rider; exit.
Put the ratio's numerator into the field's count.
Move the rider (compiler rules).
If the rider's token is not "byte" or "bytes", abort with "Nothing but the word 'bytes' is appropriate after a counted field designator." and the rider; exit.
Move the rider (compiler rules).
Put "byte" into the field's type name.
