To move a rider returning an error string (code rules - validate remark):
If the rider's token's length is less than 2, put "Remarks need to end with ']'." into the error string; exit.
If the rider's token's last's target is not the right-bracket byte, put "Remarks need to end with ']'." into the error string; exit.
