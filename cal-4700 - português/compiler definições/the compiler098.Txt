To blurt a variable into a buffer:
If the variable's compiled flag is not set, exit.
If the variable's type can be reduced to "string", blurt the variable into the buffer (as a string); exit.
Put the variable's address minus the image base into an address.
Blurt the variable's data into the buffer at the address.
