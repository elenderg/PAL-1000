To calculate the offsets in a type:
If the type is nil, exit.
Put 0 into an offset.
Loop.
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Get a field from the type's fields.
If the field is nil, exit.
If the field's redefinition target name is not blank, repeat.
Put the offset into the field's offset.
Add the field's type's length times the field's count to the offset.
Repeat.
