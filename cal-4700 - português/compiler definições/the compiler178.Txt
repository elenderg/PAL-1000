Compile some monikettes given the rider.
Find a routine given the monikettes.
If the routine is not nil, add push fragments given the monikettes.
If the routine is not nil, destroy the monikettes; add a fragment given the call internal tag and the routine; exit.
Convert the monikettes to a moniker.
