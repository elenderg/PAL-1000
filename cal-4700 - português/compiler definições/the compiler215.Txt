To compile a term given a rider and a field term (function):
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
Put the field term's function into a routine.
Put the routine's parameters' last into a parameter.
If the parameter is nil, abort with "Internal error - compile a term given a rider and an field term (function)." and the rider; exit.
If the parameter's type is nil, abort with "Internal error 2 - compile a term given a rider and an field term (function)." and the rider; exit.
Add an intermediate given the parameter's type's name and the rider's token's first.
Add a fragment given the push address tag and the intermediate.
If the field term's push flag is set, add another fragment given the push address tag and the term's variable.
Add a third fragment given the call internal tag and the routine.
Put the intermediate into the term's variable.
Clear the term's phrase.
