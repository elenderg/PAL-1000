If the moniker is in the routine index, abort with "I already know how to '" then the moniker then "'." and the routine's locus; exit.
Index the routine given the routine's monikettes and the routine index.
Move the rider (compiler rules).
If the rider's token is not any indefinite article, abort with "I was expecting an indefinite article, but found '" then the rider's token then "'." and the rider; exit.
