To add the destroy routine for a type:
If the type is nil, exit.
If the compiler's abort flag is set, exit.
If the type should not be forgotten, exit.
If the type can be reduced to "things", add the destroy routine for the type (things); exit.
If the type can be reduced to "pointer", add the destroy routine for the type (pointer); exit.
