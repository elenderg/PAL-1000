To sort some nodettes by extension:
If the nodettes' first is the nodettes' last, exit.
Split the nodettes into some left nodettes and some right nodettes.
Sort the left nodettes by extension.
Sort the right nodettes by extension.
Loop.
Put the left nodettes' first into a left nodette.
Put the right nodettes' first into a right nodette.
If the left nodette is nil, append the right nodettes to the nodettes; exit.
If the right nodette is nil, append the left nodettes to the nodettes; exit.
If the left nodette's extension is greater than the right nodette's extension, move the right nodette from the right nodettes to the nodettes; repeat.
Move the left nodette from the left nodettes to the nodettes.
Repeat.
