To center a page (vertically):
If the page is nil, exit.
Put the pad's top into the page's origin's y.
Put the pad's box's height into a height.
If the page's height is greater than the height, exit.
Put the height minus the page's height divided by 2 into an offset.
Add the offset to the page's origin's y.
