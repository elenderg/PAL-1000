To convert some rows to some paragraphs:
Destroy the paragraphs.
Loop.
Get a row from the rows.
If the row is nil, exit.
If a paragraph is nil, create the paragraph; append the paragraph to the paragraphs.
Append the row's string to the paragraph's string.
If the row's string's last's target is not the return byte, repeat.
Subtract 1 from the paragraph's string's last. \ paragraphs don't end with carriage returns; use subtract for speed
Void the paragraph.
Repeat.
