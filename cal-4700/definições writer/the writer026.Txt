To center a page (horizontally):
If the page is nil, exit.
Put the pad's left into the page's origin's x.
Put the pad's box's width into a width.
If the page's width is greater than the width, add 1/4 inch to the page's origin's x; exit.
Put the width minus the page's width divided by 2 into an offset.
Add the offset to the page's origin's x.
