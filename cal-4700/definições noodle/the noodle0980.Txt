To extract a designator from a path:
Clear the designator.
Extract a drive from the path.
Slap a path substring on the path.
Add the drive's length to the path substring's first.
If the path substring is blank, put the drive into the designator; exit.
Slap a substring on the last byte of the path substring.
If the substring's first's target is the backslash byte, subtract 1 from the substring's first.
Loop.
If the substring's first is less than the path substring's first, break.
If the substring's first's target is the backslash byte, break.
Subtract 1 from the substring's first.
Repeat.
Add 1 to the substring's first.
Put the substring into the designator.
