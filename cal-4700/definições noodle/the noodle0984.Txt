To extract a drive from a path:
Clear the drive.
If the path's length is less than 3, exit.
Slap a substring on the first byte of the path.
Add 2 to the substring's last.
If the substring ends with ":\", put the substring into the drive; exit.
If the substring does not start with "\\", exit.
Slap the substring on the first byte of the path.
Loop.
If the substring's last is greater than the path's last, exit.
If the substring's last's target is the backslash byte, add 1 to a count.
If the count is 4, break. \ "\\computer\share\"
Add 1 to the substring's last.
Repeat.
Put the substring into the drive.
