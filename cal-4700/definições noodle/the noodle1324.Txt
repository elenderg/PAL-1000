To initialize the module:
\ temp path
Put 512 into a length.
Reassign the temp path's first given the length.
Call "kernel32.dll" "GetTempPathA" with the length and the temp path's first returning the length.
Put the temp path's first plus the length minus 1 into the temp path's last.
Null terminate the temp path.
\ module handle
Call "kernel32.dll" "GetModuleHandleA" with 0 returning the module's handle.
\ module name
Put 512 into the length.
Reassign the module's path's first given the length.
Call "kernel32.dll" "GetModuleFileNameA" with the module's handle and the module's path's first and the length returning the length.
Put the module's path's first plus the length minus 1 into the module's path's last.
If the module's path starts with "\\?\", remove leading bytes from the module's path given 4.
Lowercase the module's path.
Null terminate the module's path.
\ module's other path pieces
Extract the module's name from the module's path.
Null terminate the module's name.
Extract the module's directory from the module's path.
Null terminate the module's directory.
