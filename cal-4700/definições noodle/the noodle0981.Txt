To extract a directory from a path:
Clear the directory.
Extract a drive from the path.
If the drive is blank, exit.
Slap a substring on the path.
Add the drive's length to the substring's first.
If the substring is blank, exit.
If the substring's last's target is the backslash byte, subtract 1 from the substring's last.
Loop.
If the substring is blank, break.
If the substring's last's target is the backslash byte, break.
Subtract 1 from the substring's last.
Repeat.
Put the drive then the substring into the directory.
