If the polygon is closed, append the polygon's first vertex's next's spot to the polygon; set a flag.
Put the polygon's first vertex into a left vertex.
Loop.
If the left vertex's next is nil, break.
Put the left vertex's next into a right vertex.
Get a center spot given the left vertex's spot and the right vertex's spot.
Insert the center into the polygon after the left vertex.
Put the left vertex's next into a new vertex.
If the left vertex's previous is nil, put the right vertex into the left vertex; repeat.
